<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> bringing this Handbook before the public, the
Author believes that he is supplying a want which
has been long felt. Much information concerning
the “Preparation and Mounting of Microscopic
Objects” has been already published; but mostly
as supplementary chapters only, in books written
professedly upon the Microscope. From this it is
evident that it was necessary to consult a number
of works in order to obtain anything like a
complete knowledge of the subject. These pages,
however, will be found to comprise all the most
approved methods of mounting, together with the
results of the Author’s experience, and that of
many of his friends, in every department of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
microscopic manipulation; and as it is intended to
assist the beginner as well as the advanced student,
the very rudiments of the art have not been
omitted.</p>

<p>As there is a diversity of opinion as to the best
mode of proceeding in certain cases, numerous
quotations have been made. Wherever this has
been done, the Author believes that he has acknowledged
the source from which he has taken the
information; and he here tenders his sincere
thanks to those friends who so freely allowed him
to make use of their works. Should, however,
anyone find his own process in these pages
<em>unacknowledged</em>, the author can only plead oversight,
and his regret that such should have been
the case.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Before</span> entering into the subject of the setting of Objects
for the Microscope, the student must be convinced of the
necessity of cleanliness in everything relating to the use of
that instrument. In no branch is this more apparent
than in the <em>preparation</em> of objects; because a slide which
would be considered perfectly clean when viewed in the
ordinary way is seen to be far otherwise when magnified
some hundreds of diameters; and those constant enemies,
the floating particles of dust, are everywhere present, and it
is only by unpleasant experience that we fully learn what
<em>cleanliness is</em>.</p>

<p>Any object which is to be viewed under the microscope
must, of course, be supported in some way—this is now
usually done by placing it upon a glass slide, which on
account of the transparency has a great advantage over other
substances. These “slides” are almost always made of one
size, viz., three inches long by one broad, generally having the
edges ground so as to remove all danger of scratching or
cutting any object with which they may come in contact.
The glass must be very good, else the surface will always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
present the appearance of uncleanliness and dust. This
dusty look is very common amongst the cheaper kinds of
slides, because they are usually “sheet” glass; but is
seldom found in those of the quality known amongst dealers
by the name of “patent plate.” This latter is more expensive
at first, but in the end there is little difference in the
cost, as so many of the cheaper slides cannot be used for
delicate work if the mounted object is to be seen in perfection.
These slides vary considerably in thickness; care should,
therefore, be taken to sort them, so that the more delicate
objects with which the higher powers are to be used maybe
mounted upon the <em>thinnest</em>, as the light employed in the
illumination is then less interfered with. To aid the microscopist
in this work, a metal circle may be procured, having
a number of different sized openings on the outer edge, by
which the glass slides can be measured. These openings
are numbered, and the slides may be separated according
to these numbers; so that when mounting any object there
will be no need of a long search for that glass which is best
suited to it.</p>

<p>When fresh from the dealer’s hands, these slides are
generally covered with dust, &amp;c., which may be removed by
well washing in clean rain-water; but if the impurity is
obstinate, a little washing soda may be added, care being
taken, however, that every trace of this is removed by subsequent
waters, otherwise the crystals will afterwards form
upon the surface. A clean linen cloth should be used to
dry the slides, after which they may be laid by for use.
Immediately, however, before being used for the reception of
objects by any of the following processes, all dust must be
removed by rubbing the surface with clean wash-leather or
a piece of cambric, and, <em>if needful</em>, breathing upon it, and
then using the leather or cambric until perfectly dry. Any
small particles left upon the surface may generally be
removed by blowing gently upon it, taking care to allow no
damp to remain.</p>

<p>We have before said, that any object to be viewed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
microscope must have its support; but if this object is to
be preserved, care must be taken that it is defended from
the dust and other impurities. For this purpose it is necessary
to use some transparent cover, the most usual at one
time being a plate of mica, on account of its thinness; this
substance is now, however, never used, thin glass being
substituted, which answers admirably. Sometimes it is
required to “<em>take up</em>” as little space as possible, owing to
the shortness of focus of the object-glasses. It can be procured
of any thickness, from one-fiftieth to one-two-hundred-and-fiftieth
of an inch. On account of its want of strength
it is difficult to cut, as it is very liable to “<em>fly</em>” from the
point of the diamond. To overcome this tendency as much
as possible, it must be laid upon a thicker piece, previously
made wet with water, which causes the thin glass to adhere
more firmly, and consequently to bear the pressure required
in cutting the covers. The process of cutting being so
difficult, especially with the thinner kinds, little or nothing
is gained by cutting those which can be got from the dealers,
as the loss and breakage is necessarily greater in the hands
of an amateur. It is convenient, however, to have on hand
a few larger pieces, from which unusual sizes may be cut
when required.</p>

<p>If the pieces required are <em>rectangular</em>, no other apparatus
will be required save a diamond and a flat rule; but if
<em>circles</em> are wanted, a machine for that purpose should be
used (of which no description is necessary here). There
are, however, other contrivances which answer tolerably
well. One method is, to cut out from a thick piece of
cardboard a circle rather larger than the size wanted.
Dr. Carpenter recommends metal rings with a piece of
wire soldered on either side; and this, perhaps, is the
best, as cardboard is apt to become rough at the edge when
much used. A friend of mine uses thin brass plates with
circles of various sizes “turned” through them, and a small
raised handle placed at one end. The diamond must be
passed round the inner edge, and so managed as to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
again in the same line, in order that the circle may be true,
after which they may be readily disengaged. The sizes
usually kept in stock by the dealers are one-half, five-eighths,
and three-quarters inch diameter; but other sizes
may be had to order.</p>

<p>For the information of the beginner it may be mentioned
here that the price of the circles is a little more than of the
squares; but this is modified in some degree by the circle
being rather lighter. If appearance, however, is cared for
at all, the circles look much neater upon the slides when
not covered with the ornamental papers; but if these last
are used (as will shortly be described) the squares are
equally serviceable.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, the thin glass is made of various
thicknesses, and the beginner will wish to know which to
use. For objects requiring no higher power than the one-inch
object-glass, the thicker kinds serve well enough; for
the half-inch the medium thickness will be required; while,
for higher powers, the thinnest covers must be used. The
“test-objects” for the highest powers require to be brought
so near to the object-glass that they admit of the very
thinnest covering only, and are usually mounted betwixt
glasses which a beginner would not be able to use without
frequent breakage; but if these objects were mounted with
the common covers, they would be really worthless with the
powers which they require to show them satisfactorily.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to know how such small differences
as those betwixt the various thin glass covers can be
measured. For this purpose there are two or three sorts of
apparatus, all, however, depending upon the same principle.
The description of one, therefore, will be sufficient. Upon a
small stand is a short metal <em>lever</em> (as it may be termed)
which returns by a spring to one certain position, where it
is in contact with a fixed piece of metal. At the other end
this lever is connected with a “finger,” which moves round
a dial like that of a watch, whereupon are figures at fixed
distances. When the lever is separated from the metal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
which is stationary, the other end being connected with the
“finger” of the dial, that “finger” is moved in proportion
to the distance of the separation. The thin glass is, therefore,
thrust betwixt the end of the lever and fixed metal, and
each piece is measured by the figures on the dial in stated
and accurate degrees. This kind of apparatus, however,
is expensive, and when not at our command, the thin
glass may be placed edgewise in the stage forceps, and
measured very accurately with the micrometer.</p>

<p>Cleanliness with the thin glass is, perhaps, more necessary
than with the slides, especially when covering objects which
are to be used with a high power; but it is far more difficult
to attain, on account of the liability to breakage. The
usual method of cleaning these covers is as follows:—Two
discs of wood, about two inches in diameter, are procured,
one side of each being perfectly flat and covered with
clean wash-leather. To the other side of these a small knob
is firmly affixed as a handle, or where practicable the whole
may be made out of a solid piece. In cleaning thin glass,
it should be placed betwixt the covered sides of the discs,
and may then be safely rubbed with a sufficient pressure,
and so cleaned on both sides by the leather. If, however,
the glass be greasy, as is sometimes the case, it must be
first washed with a strong solution of potash, infusion of nut-galls,
or any of the commonly used grease-removing liquids;
and with <em>some</em> impurities water, with the addition of a few
drops of strong acid, will be found very useful, but this last
is not often required.</p>

<p>The above method of cleaning thin glass should always be
used by beginners; but after some experience the hand
becomes so sensitive that the above apparatus is often
dispensed with, and the glasses, however thin, may be
safely cleaned betwixt the fingers and thumb with a cambric
handkerchief, having first slightly damped the ends of the
fingers employed to obtain firm hold. When the dirt is very
obstinate, breathing upon the glass greatly facilitates its
removal, and the sense of touch becomes so delicate that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the breakage is inconsiderable; but this method cannot be
recommended to novices, as nothing but time spent in delicate
manipulation can give the sensitiveness required.</p>

<p>It was before mentioned that the ordinary glass slides
were sometimes worthless, <em>especially for fine objects</em>, from
having a rough surface, which presented a dusty appearance
under the microscope. This imperfection exists in some
<em>thin glass</em> also, and it is irremediable; so that it is useless
to attempt to cleanse it; nevertheless, care should be taken
not to mistake dirty glass for this roughness, lest good
glass be laid aside for a fault which does not really belong
to it.</p>

<p>When any object which it is desired to mount is of considerable
thickness, or will not bear pressure, it is evident
that a wall must be raised around it to support the thin
glass—this is usually termed a “cell.” There are various
descriptions of these, according to the class of objects they
are required to protect; and here may be given a description
of those which are most generally used in mounting
“dry” objects, leaving those required for the preservation
of liquids until we come to the consideration of that mode
of mounting. Many have made use of the following slides.
Two pieces of hard wood of the usual size (3 in. by 1 in.), not
exceeding one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness, are taken, and
a hole is then drilled in the middle of one of these
of the size required. The two pieces are then united
by glue or other cement, and left under pressure until
thoroughly dry, when the cell is fit for use. Others substitute
cardboard for the lower piece of wood, which is less
tedious, and is strong enough for every purpose. This class
of “cell” is, of course, fitted for opaque objects only where
no light is required from below; and as almost all such are
better seen when on a dark background, it is usual to fix a
small piece of black paper at the bottom of the cell upon
which to place them. For very small objects the “grain”
which all such paper has when magnified detracts a little
from the merit of this background; and lately I have used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
a small piece of thin glass covered on the back with black
varnish, and placed the object upon the smooth untouched
side.</p>

<p>Another method of making these cells is as follows:—Two
“punches,” similar to those used for cutting “gun-wads,”
are procured, of such sizes that with the smaller may be cut
out the centre of the larger, leaving a ring whose side is not
less than one-eighth of an inch wide. These rings may be
readily made, the only difficulty being to keep the sides
parallel; but a little care will make this easy enough. For
this purpose close-grained cardboard may be conveniently
used. It must have a well-glazed surface, else the varnish
or cement used in affixing the thin glass cover sinks into the
substance, and the adherence is very imperfect. When this
takes place it is easily remedied by brushing over the surface
of the cardboard a strong solution of gum or isinglass;
and this application, perhaps, closes also the pores
of the card, and so serves a double purpose. But, of
course, the gum must be <em>perfectly</em> dried before the ring is
used.</p>

<p>For cardboard, gutta-percha has been substituted, but
cannot be recommended, as it always becomes brittle after
a certain time, never adheres to the glass with the required
firmness, and its shape is altered when worked with even a
little heat. Leather is often used, and is very convenient;
it should be chosen, however, of a close texture, and free
from oil, grease, and all those substances which are laid
upon it by the “dressers.”</p>

<p>Rings of cardboard, &amp;c., have been rejected by persons of
great experience, because they are of such a nature that
dampness can penetrate them. This fault can be almost, if
not totally, removed by immersing them in some strong
varnish, such as the asphalt varnish hereinafter mentioned;
but they must be left long enough when affixed to the glass
slide to become <em>perfectly dry</em>, and this will require a much
longer time than at first would be supposed.</p>

<p>There has, however, been lately brought out what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
termed the <em>ivory cell</em>. This is a ring of ivory-like substance,
which may be easily and firmly fixed to the glass slide by
any of the commonly-used cements, and so forms a beautiful
cell for any dry objects. They are made of different sizes,
and are not expensive.</p>

<p>Sometimes slides are used which are made by taking a
thin slip of wood of the usual size (3 in. by 1 in.), in the
centre of which is cut a circular hole large enough to receive
the object. A piece of thin glass is fixed underneath the
slide, forming a cell for the object, which may then be
covered and finished like an ordinary slide. This has the
advantage of serving for transparent objects for which the
before-mentioned wooden slides are unsuitable. A slight
modification of this plan is often used where the thickness
of the objects is inconsiderable, especially with some of the
Diatomaceæ, often termed “test-objects.” The wooden slide
is cut with the central opening as above, and two pieces of
thin glass are laid upon it, betwixt which the diatoms or
other objects are placed, and kept in their proper position
by a paper cover. This arrangement is a good one, insomuch
as the very small portion of glass through which the
light passes on its way to the microscope from the reflector
causes the refraction or interference to be reduced to the
lowest point.</p>

<p>A novice would naturally think the appearance of some
of the slides above mentioned very slovenly and unfinished;
but they are often covered with ornamental papers, which
may be procured at almost every optician’s, at a cost
little more than nominal, and of innumerable patterns and
colours. How to use these will be described in another
place.</p>

<p>It is very probable that a beginner would ask his friend
what kind of slides he would advise him to use. Almost
all those made of wood are liable to warp more or less, even
when the two pieces are separate or of different kinds; those
of cardboard and wood are generally free from this fault,
yet the slides, being opaque, prevent the employment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the Lieberkuhn. To some extent glass slides, when covered
with ornamental papers, are liable to the same objection,
as the light is partly hindered. And sometimes the
dampness from the paste, or other substance used to affix
the papers, penetrates to the object, and so spoils it, though
this may be rendered less frequent by first attaching the
<em>thin</em> glass to the slide by some harder cement. Much
time, however, is taken up by the labour of covering
the slides, which is a matter of consideration with some.
Certainly, the cost of the glass slides was formerly great;
but now they are reasonable enough in this respect, so that
this objection is removed. It is, therefore, well to use glass
slides, except where the thin glasses are employed for tests,
&amp;c., as above. When the thin glass circles are placed
upon the slides, and the edge is varnished with black or
coloured rings, the appearance of finish is perfect. The
trouble is much less than with most of the other methods,
and the illumination of the object very slightly interfered
with.</p>

<p>To varnish the edges of these covers, make circles of any
liquid upon the glass slide, and perform any other “circular”
work mentioned hereafter, the little instrument known as
“Shadbolt’s turntable” is almost indispensable. It is made
as follows:—At one end of a small piece of hard wood is
fixed an iron pivot about one-eighth inch thick, projecting
half an inch from the wood, which serves as a centre upon
which a round brass table three inches in diameter revolves.
On the surface of this are two springs, about one
and a half inches apart, under which the slide is forced and
so kept in position, whilst the central part is left open to
be worked upon. The centre is marked, and two circles half
an inch and one inch in diameter are usually deeply engraved
upon the table to serve as guides in placing the slide,
that the ring may be drawn in the right position. When
the slide is placed upon the “table” underneath the springs,
a camel-hair pencil is filled with the varnish, or other
medium used, and applied to the surface of the glass; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
table is then made to revolve, and a circle is consequently
produced, the diameter of which it is easy to regulate.</p>

<p>Many objects for the microscope may be seriously injured
by allowing the fingers to touch them—many more are
so minute that they cannot be removed in this way at all,
and often it is necessary to take from a mass of small
grains, as in sand, some particular particle. To accomplish
this, there are two or three contrivances recommended: one
by means of split bristles, many of which will readily be
found in any shaving brush when it has been well used.
The bristles when pressed upon any hard surface open,
and when the pressure is removed close again with a spring;
but the use of these is limited. Camel-hair pencils are of
great service for this and many other purposes to the
microscopist. In <em>very</em> fine work they are sometimes required
so small that all the hairs with the exception of one or two
finer pointed ones are removed. A few of various sizes
should always be kept on hand.</p>

<p>Equally necessary are fine pointed needles. They are very
readily put up for use by thrusting the “eye” end into a
common penholder, so as to be firm. The points may be
readily renewed, when injured, on a common whetstone; but
when out of use they may be protected by being thrust into
a piece of cork.</p>

<p>Knives of various kinds are required in some branches
of microscopic work, but these will be described where
“dissection,” &amp;c., is treated at some length, as also various
forms of scissors. In the most simple objects, however,
scissors of the usual kind are necessary. Two or three
sizes should always be kept at hand, sharp and in good
order.</p>

<p>A set of glass tubes, kept in a case of some sort to
prevent breakage, should form part of our “fittings” and
be always cleaned immediately after use. These are
generally from six to ten inches long and from one-eighth
to a quarter of an inch in diameter. One of these should
be straight and equal in width at both ends; one should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
drawn out gradually to a fine point; another should be
pointed as the last, but be slightly curved at the compressed
end, in order to reach points otherwise unattainable. It is
well to have these tubes of various widths at the points, as
in some waters the finer would be inevitably stopped. For
other purposes the fine ones are very useful, especially in
the transfer of “preservative liquids” which will come
under notice in another chapter.</p>

<p>Forceps are required in almost all microscopic manipulations,
and consequently are scarcely ever omitted from the
microscopic box, even the most meagrely furnished; but of
these there are various modifications, which for certain
purposes are more convenient than the usual form. The
ordinary metal ones are employed for taking up small
objects, thin glass, &amp;c.; but when slides are to be held over
a lamp, or in any position where the fingers cannot conveniently
be used, a different instrument must be found.
Of these there are many kinds; but Mr. Page’s wooden
forceps serve the purpose very well. Two pieces of elastic
wood are strongly bound together at one end, so that they
may be easily opened at the other, closing again by their
own elasticity. Through the first of these pieces is loosely
passed a brass stud, resembling a small screw, and fastened in
the second, and through the second a similar stud is taken
and fixed in the first—so that on pressure of the studs the
two strips of wood are opened to admit a slide or other
object required to be held in position. The wood strips are
generally used three or four inches long, one inch wide, and
about one-eighth inch thick.</p>

<p>Again, some objects when placed upon the glass slide are
of such an elastic nature that no cement will secure the
thin glass covering until it becomes hard. This difficulty
may be overcome by various methods. The following are
as good and simple as any. Take two pieces of wood about
two inches long, three-quarters wide, and one-quarter thick;
and a small rounded piece one inch long and one-quarter in
diameter; place this latter betwixt the two larger pieces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Over one end of the two combined pass an india-rubber
band. This will give a continual pressure, and may be
opened by bringing the two pieces together at the other
end; the pressure may be readily made uniform by paring
the points at the inner sides, and may be regulated
by the strength of the india-rubber band. These bands
may be made cheaply, and of any power, by procuring a
piece of india-rubber tubing of the width required, and
cutting off certain breadths. Another very simple method
of getting this pressure is mentioned in the “Micrographic
Dictionary.” Two pieces of whalebone of the length required
are tied together firmly at each end. It is evident
that any object placed betwixt them will be subject to
continual pressure. The power of this may be regulated
by the thickness and length of the whalebone. This simple
contrivance is very useful.</p>

<p>Common watch-glasses should always be kept at hand.
They are certainly the cheapest, and their transparency
makes them very convenient reservoirs in which objects
may be steeped in any liquid; as it saves much trouble
to examine cursorily under the microscope, when the air-bubbles
are expelled from insects, &amp;c., &amp;c. They are
readily cleaned, and serve very well as covers, when turned
upside down, to protect any objects from the dust. For
this latter purpose Dr. Carpenter recommends the use
of a number of bell-glasses, especially when one object
must be left for a time (which often happens) in order
that another may be proceeded with. Wine glasses,
when the “legs” are broken, may thus be rendered very
useful.</p>

<p>As heat is necessary in mounting many objects, a lamp
will be required. Where gas is used, the small lamp known
as “Bunsen’s” is the most convenient and inexpensive. It
gives great heat, is free from smoke, and is readily affixed
to the common gas-burner by a few feet of india-rubber
tubing. The <em>light</em> from these lamps is small, but this is
little or no drawback to their use. Where gas is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
available, the common spirit-lamps may be used, which are
very clean and answer every purpose.</p>

<p>In applying the required heat to the slides, covers, &amp;c., it
is necessary in many cases to ensure uniformity, otherwise
there is danger of the glass being broken. For this purpose
a brass plate at least three inches wide, somewhat longer,
and one-eighth of an inch thick, must be procured. It
should then be affixed to a stand, so that it may be readily
moved higher or lower, in order that the distance from
the lamp may be changed at will, and thus the degree
of heat more easily regulated. This has also the advantage
of enabling the operator to allow his slides, &amp;c., to cool
more gradually, which, in some cases, is absolutely necessary,—as
in fusing some of the salts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In order to get rid of air-bubbles, which are frequently
disagreeable enemies to the mounter of objects, an air-pump
is often very useful. This is made by covering a circular
plate of metal with a bell-glass, both of which are ground so
finely at the edges that greasing the place of contact renders
it air-tight. The pump is then joined to the metal plate
underneath, and worked with a small handle like a common
syringe. By turning a small milled head the air may be
allowed to re-enter when it is required to remove the bell-glass
and examine or perform any operation upon the
object. The mode of using this instrument will be described
hereafter, but it may be here stated that substitutes
have been devised for this useful apparatus; but as it is
now to be obtained at a low cost, it is hardly worth while
to consider them. Much time is, in many instances, certainly
saved by its use, as a very long immersion in the
liquids would be required to expel the bubbles, where the
air-pump would remove them in an hour.</p>

<p>The next thing to be considered is what may be termed
<span class="smcap">Cements</span>, some of which are necessary in every method of
mounting objects for the microscope. Of these will be given
the composition where it is probable the young student can
make use of it; but many of them are so universally kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
as to be obtainable almost anywhere; and when small quantities
only are required, economy suffers more from home
manufacture than from paying the maker’s profit.</p>

<p>Amongst these, <span class="smcap">Canada Balsam</span> may, perhaps, be termed
the most necessary, as it is generally used for the preservation
of many transparent objects. It is a thick liquid
resin of a light amber colour, which on exposure to the
atmosphere becomes dry and hard even to brittleness. For
this reason it is seldom used as a <em>cement</em> alone where the
surface of contact is small, as it would be apt to be displaced
by any sudden shock, especially when old. In the ordinary
method of using, however, it serves the double purpose of
preserving the object and fixing the thin glass cover;
whilst the comparatively large space upon which it lies
lessens the risk of displacement. By keeping, this substance
becomes thicker; but a very little warmth will
render it liquid enough to use even when to some extent
this change has taken place. When heated, however,
for some time and allowed to cool, it becomes hardened
to any degree, which may be readily regulated by the
length of time it has been exposed, and the amount of
heat to which it has been subjected. On account of this
property it is often used with chloroform: the balsam is
exposed to heat until, on cooling, it assumes a glassy appearance;
it is then dissolved in pure chloroform until it
becomes of the consistence of thick varnish. This liquid is
very convenient in some cases; as air-bubbles are much
more easily got rid of than when undiluted Canada balsam
is used. It also dries readily, as the chloroform evaporates
very quickly, for which reason it must be preserved in a
closely-stoppered bottle. It has been said that this mixture
becomes <em>cloudy</em> with long keeping, but I have not found it
so in any cases where I have used it. Should it, however,
become so, a little heat will readily dispel the opacity. The
ordinary balsam, if exposed much to the air whilst being
used, becomes thicker, as has been already stated. It may
be reduced to the required consistency with common turpentine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
but I have often found this in some degree injurious
to the transparency of the balsam, and the amalgamation
of the two is by no means perfect. (See also <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>)
The cheapness of the article renders it no extravagance to
use it always undiluted; and when preserved in a bottle
with a hollow cover fitting tightly around the neck, both
surfaces being finely ground, it remains fit for use much
longer than in the ordinary jar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asphaltum.</span>—This substance is dissolved in linseed oil,
turpentine, or naphtha, and is often termed “Brunswick
black.” It is easily worked, but is not generally deemed a
<em>trustworthy</em> cement, as after a time it is readily loosened
from its ground. It is, however, very useful for some purposes
(such as “finishing” the slides), as it dries quickly.
I shall, however, mention a modification of this cement a
little further on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marine Glue.</span>—No cement is more useful or trustworthy
for certain purposes than this. It is made in various
proportions; but one really good mixture is—equal parts
of india-rubber and gum shellac; these are dissolved in
mineral naphtha with heat. It is, however, much better to
get it from the opticians or others who keep it. It
requires heat in the application, as will be explained in
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>; but it is soluble in few, if any, liquids used by
the microscopist, and for that reason is serviceable in the
manufacture of cells, &amp;c. Where two pieces of glass are to
be firmly cemented together, it is almost always employed;
and in all glass troughs, plates with ledges, &amp;c., the beginner
may find examples of its use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold Size.</span>—This substance may always be procured at
any colourman’s shop. The process of its preparation is
long and tedious. It is, therefore, not necessary to describe
it here. Dr. Carpenter says that it is very durable, and
may be used with almost any preservative liquids, as it is
acted upon by very few of them, turpentine being its only
true solvent. If too thin, it may be exposed for awhile to
the open air, which by evaporation gradually thickens it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Care must be taken, however, not to render it too thick, as
it will then be useless. A small quantity should be kept on
hand, as it is much more adhesive when <em>old</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liquid Glue</span> is another of these cements, which is made
by dissolving gum shellac in naphtha in such quantity
that it may be of the required consistency. This cement
appears to me almost worthless in ordinary work, as its
adherence can never be relied upon; but it is so often
used and recommended that an enumeration of cements
might be deemed incomplete without it. Even when employed
simply for varnishing the outside of the glass covers,
for appearance’ sake alone, it invariably chips. Where,
however, oil is used as a preservative liquid, it serves very
well to attach the thin glass; but when this is accomplished,
another varnish less liable to “chip” must always be laid
upon it. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Japan.</span>—This is prepared from oil of turpentine,
linseed oil, amber, gum anime, and asphalt. It is troublesome
to make, and therefore it is much better to procure it
at the shops. It is a really good cement, and serves very
well to make shallow cells for liquids, as will be described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a> The finished cell should be exposed for a
short time to the heat of what is usually termed a “cool
oven.” This renders it very durable, and many very careful
manipulators make use of it for their preparations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Electrical Cement.</span>—This will be found very good for
some purposes hereinafter described. To make it, melt
<span class="locked">together—</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Dr. Griffiths says that the addition of 2 parts of Canada balsam
renders this cement much more adhesive to the glass.</p></div>

<p>It must be used whilst hot, and as long as it retains even
slight warmth can be readily moulded into any form. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
often employed in making shallow cells for liquids, as before
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum-Water</span> is an article which nobody should ever be
without; but labels, or indeed any substance, affixed to glass
with common gum, are so liable to leave it spontaneously,
especially when kept very dry, that I have lately added five
or six drops of glycerine to an ounce of the gum solution.
This addition has rendered it very trustworthy even on
glass, and now I never use it without. This solution cannot
be kept long without undergoing fermentation, to prevent
which the addition of a small quantity of any essential oil
(as oil of cloves, &amp;c.), or one-fourth of its volume of alcohol,
may be made, which will not interfere in any way with
its use.</p>

<p>There is what is sometimes termed an <em>extra adhesive</em>
gum-water, which is made with the addition of isinglass,
thus:—Dissolve two drachms of isinglass in four ounces
of distilled vinegar; add as much gum arabic as will give
it the required consistency. This will keep very well, but
is apt to become thinner, when a little more gum may
be added.</p>

<p>All these, except one or two, are liquid, and must be kept
in <em>stoppered</em> bottles, or, at least, as free from the action of
the air as possible.</p>

<p>When any two substances are to be united firmly, I have
termed the medium employed “a cement;” but often the
appearance of the slides is thought to be improved by drawing
a coloured ring upon them, extending partly on the cover
and partly on the slide, hiding the junction of the two.
The medium used in these cases I term <span class="smcap">a Varnish</span>, and
hereinafter mention one or two. Of course, the tenacity is
not required to be so perfect as in the <em>cements</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sealing-wax Varnish</span> is prepared by coarsely powdering
sealing wax, and adding spirits of wine; it is then digested
at a gentle heat to the required thickness. This is very
frequently used to “finish” the slides, as before mentioned,
and can easily be made of any colour by employing different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
kinds of sealing-wax; but is very liable to “chip” and
leave the glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Varnish</span> is readily prepared by adding a small
quantity of lamp-black to gold-size and mixing intimately.
Dr. Carpenter recommends this as a good finishing varnish,
drying quickly and being free from that brittleness
which renders some of the others almost worthless; but it
should not be used in the first process when mounting
objects in fluid.</p>

<p>Amongst these different cements and varnishes I worked
a long time without coming to any decision as to their
comparative qualities, though making innumerable experiments.
The harder kinds were continually cracking, and
the softer possessed but little adhesive power. To find
hardness and adhesiveness united was my object, and the
following possesses these qualities in a great <span class="locked">degree:—</span></p>

<table class="narrow20" summary="black varnish">

</table>

<p class="in0">Dissolve the india-rubber in the naphtha, then add the
asphaltum—if necessary heat must be employed.</p>

<p class="p2">This is often used by photographers as a black varnish
for glass, and never cracks, whilst it is very adhesive. Dr.
Carpenter, however, states that his experience has not been
favourable to it; but I have used it in great quantities and
have never found it to leave the glass in a single instance
when used in the above proportions. The objections to it
are, however, I think easily explained, when it is known
that there are many kinds of pitch, &amp;c., from coal, sold by
the name of asphaltum, some of which are worthless in
making a microscopic cement. When used for this purpose,
the asphaltum must be genuine and of the best quality
that can be bought. The above mixture serves a double
purpose—to unite the cell to the slide, and also as a “finishing”
varnish. But it is perhaps more convenient to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
two bottles of this cement, one of which is thicker than
common varnish, to use for uniting the cell, &amp;c.; the other
liquid enough to flow readily, which may be employed as
a surface varnish in finishing the slides.</p>

<p>The brushes or camel-hair pencils should always be
cleaned after use; but with the asphalt varnish above
mentioned it is sufficient to wipe off as carefully as possible
the superfluous quantity which adheres to the pencil, as,
when again made use of, the varnish will readily soften it;
but, of course, it will be necessary to keep separate brushes
for certain purposes.</p>

<p>Here it may be observed that every object should be
labelled with name and any other descriptive item as soon
as mounted. There are many little differences in the
methods of doing this. Some write with a diamond upon
the slide itself; but this has the disadvantage of being not
so easily seen. For this reason a small piece of paper is
usually affixed to one end of the slide, on which is written
what is required. These labels may be bought of different
colours and designs; but the most simple are quite as good,
and very readily procured. Take a sheet of thin writing
paper and brush over one side a strong solution of gum,
with the addition of a few drops of glycerine as above recommended;
allow this to dry, and then with a common
gun-punch stamp out the circles, which may be affixed
to the slides by simply damping the gummed surface, taking
care to write the required name, &amp;c., upon it before damping
it, or else allowing it to become perfectly dry first.</p>

<p>There is one difficulty which a beginner often experiences
in sorting and mounting certain specimens under the microscope,
viz., the <em>inversion</em> of the objects; and it is often
stated to be almost impossible to work without an erector.
But this difficulty soon vanishes, the young student becoming
used to working what at first seems in contradiction to his
sight.</p>

<p>Let it be understood, that in giving the description of
those articles which are usually esteemed <em>necessary</em> in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
various parts of microscopic manipulation, I do not mean to
say that without many of these no work of any value can
be done. There are, as all will allow, certain forms of
apparatus which aid the operator considerably; but the
cost may be too great for him. A little thought, however,
will frequently overcome this difficulty, by enabling him to
make, or get made, for himself, at a comparatively light
expense, something which will accomplish all he desires.
As an example of this, a friend of mine made what he terms
his “universal stand,” to carry various condensers, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
in the following way:—Take a steel or brass wire, three-sixteenths
or one-quarter inch thick and six or eight inches
long; “tap” into a <em>solid</em>, or make rough and fasten with
melted lead into a <em>hollow</em>, ball. (The foot of a cabinet
or work-box answers the purpose very well.) In the centre
of a round piece of tough board, three inches in diameter,
make a hemispherical cavity to fit half of the ball, and
bore a hole through from the middle of this cavity, to allow
the wire to pass. Take another piece of board, about four
inches in diameter, either round or square, and one-and-a-half
or two inches thick, make a similar cavity in its centre
to receive the other half of the ball, but only so deep as to
allow the ball to fit tightly when the two pieces of board are
screwed together, which last operation must be done with
three or four screws. Let the hole for the wire in the upper
part be made conical (base upwards), and so large as only to
prevent the ball from escaping from its socket, in order that
the shaft may move about as freely as possible. Turn a
cavity, or make holes, in the bottom of the under piece, and
fill with lead to give weight and steadiness. This, painted
green bronze and varnished, looks neat; and by having
pieces of gutta-percha tubing to fit the shaft, a great variety
of apparatus may be attached to it.</p>

<p>Again, a “condenser” is often required for the illumination
of opaque objects. My ingenious friend uses an
“engraver’s bottle” (price 6d.), fills it with water, and
suspends it betwixt the light and the object. Where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
light is very yellow, he tints the water with indigo, and so
removes the objectionable colour.</p>

<p>I merely mention these as examples of what may be done
by a little thoughtful contrivance, and to remove the idea
that nothing is of much value save that which is the work
of professional workmen, and consequently expensive.</p>

<span class="subhead">TO PREPARE AND MOUNT OBJECTS “DRY.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> term “dry” is used when the object to be mounted is
not immersed in any liquid or medium, but preserved in its
natural state, unless it requires cleaning and drying.</p>

<p>I have before stated that thorough cleanliness is necessary
in the mounting of all microscopic objects. I may here add
that almost every kind of substance used by the microscopist
suffers from careless handling. Many leaves with fine hairs
are robbed of half their beauty, or the hairs, perhaps, forced
into totally different shapes and groups; many insects lose
their scales, which constitute their chief value to the microscopist;
even the glass itself distinctly shows the marks
of the fingers if left uncleaned. Every object must also be
<em>thoroughly dry</em>, otherwise dampness will arise and become
condensed in small drops upon the inner surface of the thin
glass cover. This defect is frequently met with in slides
which have been mounted quickly; the objects not being
thoroughly dry when enclosed in the cell. Many of the
cheap slides are thus rendered worthless. Even with every
care it is not possible to get rid of this annoyance occasionally.</p>

<p>For the purpose of mounting opaque objects “dry,”
<em>discs</em> were at one time very commonly made use of.
These are circular pieces of cork, leather, or other soft substance,
from one-quarter to half inch in diameter, blackened
with varnish or covered with black paper, on which the
object is fixed by gum or some other adhesive substance.
They are usually pierced longitudinally by a strong pin,
which serves for the forceps to lay hold of when being
placed under the microscope for examination. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
objects are affixed to both sides of the disc, which is
readily turned when under the object-glass. The advantage
of this method of mounting is the ease with which the disc
may be moved, and so present every part of the object to
the eye save that by which it is fastened to the disc. On
this account it is often made use of when some particular
subject is undergoing investigation, as a number of specimens
may be placed upon the discs with very little labour,
displaying all the parts. But where exposure to the atmosphere
or small particles of dust will injure an object, no
advantage which the discs may possess should be considered,
and an ordinary covered cell should be employed. Small
pill-boxes have been used, to the bottom of which a piece
of cork has been glued to afford a ground for the pin or
other mode of attachment; but this is liable to <em>some</em> of the
same faults as the disc, and it would be unwise to use these
for permanent objects.</p>

<p>Messrs. Smith and Beck have lately invented, and are
now making, a beautiful small apparatus, by means of
which the disc supporting the object can be worked with
little or no trouble into any position that may prove most
convenient, whilst a perforated cylinder serves for the
reception of the discs when out of use, and fits into a case
to protect them from dust. A pair of forceps is made for
the express purpose of removing them from the case and
placing them in the holder.</p>

<p>All dry objects, however, which are to be preserved should
be mounted on glass slides in one of the cells (described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>) best suited to them. Where the object is to be
free from pressure, care must be taken that the cell is deep
enough to ensure this. When the depth required is but
small, it is often sufficient to omit the card, leather, or other
circles, and with the “turn-table” before described, by
means of a thick varnish and camel-hair pencil, to form a
ring of the desired depth; but should the varnish not be of
sufficient substance to give such “walls” at once, the
first application may be allowed to dry, and a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
made upon it. A number of these may be prepared at the
same time, and laid by for use. When liquids are used (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>), Dr. Carpenter recommends gold-size as a good
varnish for the purpose, and this may be used in “dry”
mountings also. I have used the asphaltum and india-rubber
(mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>), and found it to be everything
I could wish. The cells, however, must be <em>thoroughly
dry</em>, and when they will bear the heat they should be baked
for an hour at least in a tolerably cool oven, by which
treatment the latter becomes a first-rate medium. All dry
objects which will not bear pressure must be firmly fastened
to the slide, otherwise the necessary movements very often
injure them, by destroying the fine hairs, &amp;c. For this
purpose thin varnishes are often used, and will serve well
enough for large objects, but many smaller ones are lost by
adopting this plan, as for a time, which may be deemed long
enough to harden the varnish, they exhibit no defect, but in
a while a “wall” of the plastic gum gathers around them,
which refracts the light, and thus leads the student to
false conclusions. In all <em>finer</em> work, where it is necessary
to use any method of fixing them to the slide, a solution of
common gum, with the addition of a few drops of glycerine
(<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>), will be found to serve the purpose perfectly.
It must, however, be carefully filtered through blotting paper,
otherwise the minute particles in the solution interfere with
the object, giving the slide a dusty appearance when under
the microscope.</p>

<p>When mounting an object in any of these cells, the glass
must be thoroughly cleaned, which may be done with a
cambric handkerchief, after the washing mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter
I.</a> <em>If the object be large</em>, the point of a fine camel-hair
pencil should be dipped into the gum solution, and a minute
quantity of the liquid deposited in the cell where the object
is to be placed, but not to cover a greater surface than
the object will totally hide from sight. This drop of gum
must be allowed to dry, which will take a few minutes.
Breathe then upon it two or three times, holding the slide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
not far from the mouth, which will render the surface adhesive.
Then draw a camel-hair pencil through the lips,
so as to moisten it slightly (when anything small will adhere
to it quite firmly enough), touch the object and place it
upon the gum in the desired position. This must be done
immediately to ensure perfect stability, otherwise the gum
will become at least partially dry and only retain the object
imperfectly.</p>

<p>When, however, the objects are so minute that it would
be impossible to deposit atoms of gum small enough for
each one to cover, a different method of proceeding must be
adopted. In this case a small portion of the same gum
solution should be placed upon the slide, and by means of
any small instrument—a long needle will serve the purpose
very well—spread over the surface which will be required.
The quantity thus extended will be very small, but by
breathing upon it may be prevented drying whilst being dispersed.
This, like the forementioned, should be then allowed
to dry; and whilst the objects are being placed on the prepared
surface, breathing upon it as before will restore the
power of adherence.</p>

<p>When gum or other liquid cement has been used to fix
the objects to the glass, the thin covers must not be applied
until the slide has been <em>thoroughly dried</em>, and all fear of
dampness arising from the use of the solution done away
with. Warmth may be safely applied for the purpose, as
objects fastened by this method are seldom, if ever, found
to be loosened by it. As objects are met with of every
thickness, the cells will be required of different depths.
There is no difficulty in accommodating ourselves in this—the
deeper cells may be readily cut out of thick leather, card,
or other substance preferred (as mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>).
Cardboard is easily procured of almost any thickness; but
sometimes it is convenient to find a thinner substance even
than this. When thin glass is laid upon a drop of any
liquid upon a slide, every one must have observed how
readily the liquid spreads betwixt the two: just so when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
any thin varnish is used to surround an object of little substance,
excessive care is needed lest the varnish should
extend betwixt the cover and slide, and so render it worthless.
The slightest wall, however, prevents this from taking
place, so that a ring of common paper may be used, and serve
a double purpose where the objects require no deeper cell
than this forms.</p>

<p>Many objects, however, are of such tenuity—as the leaves
of many mosses, some of the Diatomaceæ, scales of insects,
&amp;c.—that no cell is requisite excepting that which is necessarily
formed by the medium used to attach the thin glass
cover to the slide; and where the slide is covered by the
ornamental papers mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>, and pressure
does not injure the object, even this is omitted, the thin
glass being kept in position by the cover; but slides mounted
in this manner are frequently injured by dampness, which
soon condenses upon the inner surfaces and interferes both
with the object and the clearness of its appearance.</p>

<p>The thin glass, then, is to be united to the slide, so as to
form a perfect protection from dust, dampness, or other
injurious matter, and yet allow a thoroughly distinct view
of the object. This is to be done by applying to the glass
slide round the object some adhesive substance, and with
the forceps placing the thin glass cover (quite dry and
clean) upon it. A gentle pressure round the edge will then
ensure a perfect adhesion, and with ordinary care there will
be little or no danger of breakage. For this purpose gold-size
is frequently used. The asphalt and india-rubber
varnish also will be found both durable and serviceable.
Whatever cement may be used, it is well to allow it
to become in some measure “fixed” and dried; but
where no cell or “wall” is upon the slide, this is <em>quite
necessary</em>, otherwise the varnish will be almost certain to
extend, as before mentioned, and ruin the object. It may
be stated here that gold-size differs greatly in its drying
powers, according to its age, mode of preparation, &amp;c.
(<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Should any object be enclosed which requires to be kept
flat during the drying of the cement, it will be necessary to
use some of the contrivances mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a></p>

<p>When the slide is thus far advanced, there remains the
“finishing” only. Should the student, however, have no
time to complete his work at once, he may safely leave it at
this stage until he has a number of slides which he may
finish at the same time. There are different methods of
doing this, some of which may be here described.</p>

<p>If ornamental papers are preferred, a small circle must be
cut out from the centre a little less than the thin glass
which covers the object. Another piece of coloured paper is
made of the same size, and a similar circle taken from
its centre also, or both may be cut at the same time. The
slide is then covered round the edges with paper of any
plain colour, so that it may extend about one-eighth of an
inch over the glass on every side. The ornamental paper is
then pasted on the “object” surface of the glass, so that the
circle shows the object as nearly in the centre as possible,
and covers the edges of the thin glass. The other coloured
paper is then affixed underneath with the circle coinciding
with that above. And here I may observe, that when this
method is used there is no necessity for the edges of the
slide to be “ground,” as all danger of scratching, &amp;c., is
done away with by the paper cover.</p>

<p>Many now use paper covers, about one and a half inches
long, on the upper side of the slide only, with the centre
cut out as before, with no other purpose than that of
hiding the edge of the thin glass where it is united to the
slide.</p>

<p>The method of “finishing,” however, which is mostly used
at the present time, is to lay a coating of varnish upon the
edge of the thin glass, and extend it some little way on the
slide. When a black circle is required, nothing serves the
purpose better than the gold-size and lamp-black, or the
asphalt and india-rubber varnish, neither of which is liable
to chip; but when used for this, the latter should be rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
thinner, as before advised. Some of these varnishes are
preferred of different colours, which may be made by using
the different kinds of sealing-wax, as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter
I.</a>; but they are always liable to the defects there mentioned.
This circle cannot be made in any other way but by one of
those contrivances which have now centred in Shadbolt’s
turntable. A very little practice will enable the young
student to place his slide so that the circle may be uniform
with the edge of the thin glass.</p>

<p>The slide is now complete, except the addition of the
name and any other particulars which may be desirable.
For this purpose one of the methods described in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>
must be employed.</p>

<p>Amongst the various classes of microscopic objects now
receiving general attention, the Diatomaceæ may be placed
in a prominent position. They afford endless opportunities
of research, and some very elaborate works have already
been issued concerning them. Professor Smith’s may be
mentioned as one containing, perhaps, the best illustrations.
The young student may wish to know what a diatom is.
The “Micrographic Dictionary” gives the following definition:—“A
family of confervoid Algæ, of very peculiar
character, consisting of microscopic brittle organisms.”
They are now looked upon by almost all of our scientific men
as belonging to the <em>vegetable</em> kingdom, though some few still
assign them to the animal. They are almost invariably
exceedingly small, so that the unaided eye can perceive
nothing on a prepared slide of these organisms but minute
dust. Each separate portion, which is usually seen when
mounted, is termed a “frustule,” or “testule:” this consists
of two similar parts, composed of silica, between and
sometimes around which is a mass of viscid matter called
the “endochrome.” They are found in almost every description
of water, according to the variety: some prefer sea-water,
others fresh, and many are seen nowhere but in that
which is a mixture of both, as the mouths of rivers, &amp;c.
Ditches, ponds, cisterns, and indeed almost every <em>reservoir</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
yield abundance of these forms. They are not, however, confined
to “present” life; but, owing to the almost indestructible
nature of their siliceous covering, they are found in a fossil
state in certain earths in great abundance, and are often
termed “fossil Infusoria.” Upon these frustules are generally
to be seen lines, or “markings,” of different degrees of
minuteness, the delicacy of which often serves the purpose
of testing the defining power of the object-glasses. Some of
the frustules are triangular, others circular, and, indeed,
of almost every conceivable shape, many of them presenting
us with exquisitely beautiful designs.</p>

<p>The markings, however, are seldom seen well, if at all,
until the frustules are properly prepared, the different
methods of accomplishing which will be given a little further
on.</p>

<p>The <em>collection</em> of the fresh diatoms is so closely connected
with their <em>preservation</em>, that a few notes may be given upon
it before we pass on. For this purpose a number of small
bottles must be provided, which may be placed in a
tin box, with a separate apartment for each, so that all
chance of breakage may be done away with. The diatoms
are generally of a light brown colour; and where they are
observed in the water, the bottle may be so placed, with the
mouth closed by the finger, that when the finger is withdrawn
the water will rush in, carrying the diatoms also.
If they are seen upon plants, stones, or any other substance,
they may generally be detached and placed in the bottle.
When there is a green covering upon the surface of the
water, a great quantity of diatoms is usually found amongst
it; as also upon the surface of the mud in those ponds
where they abound. In these cases, a broad flat spoon
will be found very useful, and one is now made with
a covering upon the broader portion of it to protect the
enclosed matter from being so readily carried off whilst
bringing it to the surface again. Where there is any depth
of water, and the spoon will not reach the surface of the
mud, the bottle must be united to a long rod, and being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
then carried through the upper portion with the mouth
downwards, no water will be received into it; but on reaching
the spot required, the bottle-mouth may be turned up, and
thus become filled with what is nearest.</p>

<p>From the stomachs of common fish—as the cod, sole, haddock,
&amp;c.—many specimens of Diatomaceæ may be obtained,
but especially from the crab, oyster, mussel, and other shell-fish.
Professor Smith states that from these curious receptacles
he has taken some with which he has not elsewhere
met. To remove them from any of the small shell-fish, it is
necessary to take the fish or stomach from the shell, and
immerse it in strong hot acid (nitric is the best) until the
animal matter is dissolved, when the residue must be
washed and treated as the ordinary Diatomaceæ hereinafter
described.</p>

<p>Many diatoms are seen best when mounted in a dry
state, the minute markings becoming much more indistinct
if immersed in liquid or balsam; and for this reason those
which are used as test objects are usually mounted <em>dry</em>.
Many kinds also are now prepared in this way, as opaque objects
to be examined with the lieberkuhn, and are exquisitely
beautiful. Others, however, are almost invariably mounted
in balsam; but as these will be again referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter
III.</a>, and require the same treatment to fit them for the
slide, it will not be out of place to describe the cleaning
and preparation of them here. As before stated, there is
much matter surrounding them which must be got rid of
before the “<em>siliceous</em> covering” can be shown perfectly.
As, however, we may first wish to become acquainted in
some degree with what we have to do, it is well to take a
small piece of <em>talc</em>, and place a few of the diatoms upon it.
This may be held over the flame of the spirit-lamp until all
the surrounding matter is burnt away, and a tolerable idea
may be thus obtained as to the quality of our treasure.</p>

<p>In some cases it is well to use this burning operation
alone in <em>mounting</em> specimens of diatoms, when they may be
placed in their natural state upon the thin glass, burnt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
awhile upon the platinum plate, hereafter described, and
mounted dry or in balsam.</p>

<p>In the preparation and cleaning of Diatomaceæ, there is
little satisfaction unless these operations have been successfully
performed, as a very small portion of foreign matter
seriously interferes with the object. The mode of preparing
them varies even amongst the most experienced. It will be
found, therefore, most satisfactory to examine the principal
of these separately, although it may be at the risk of some
little repetition.</p>

<p>The method which is the most frequently made use of is
the following:—Place the “gathering” containing the Diatomaceæ
in a small glass or porcelain vessel, add strong
nitric acid, and, by the aid of Bunsen’s burner or spirit-lamp,
boil for some minutes. From time to time a drop of the
mixture may be put upon a slide, and examined under the
microscope to see if all foreign matter be got rid of. When
the valves are clean, the vessel containing them must be
filled with water, and the whole left for an hour or two, so
that all the diatoms may settle perfectly. The liquid must
then be poured off carefully, or drained away by the aid of
a syphon, so that none of the diatoms are removed with it.
Indeed, it is well to examine the liquid drained off each
time with the microscope, as the finer forms are frequently
lost in the washings. The vessel must then be refilled with
pure water, allowed to settle, and drained as before. This
washing must be repeated until a drop being placed upon
a slide and evaporated leaves no crystals. When it is
desirable to preserve the diatoms in this state before mounting
(which process will be described in another place), they may
be placed in a small phial with a little distilled water.</p>

<p>There are many cases in which the above method will
not effect a <em>perfect</em> cleansing, as certain substances with
which the diatoms are frequently mixed are not soluble in
<em>nitric acid</em>. For this reason the following method is resorted
to:—Take a quantity of the matter containing the Diatomaceæ
and wash first with pure water, to get rid of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the impurities possible. Allow this to settle perfectly and
decant the water. Add hydrochloric acid gradually, and
when all effervescence has subsided, boil for some minutes by
aid of the lamp. When cool and the particles have subsided,
decant the hydrochloric and add nitric acid. The
boiling must then be repeated until a drop of the liquid
when placed under the microscope shows the valves or
“frustules” clean. After allowing the diatoms to settle,
the acid must be decanted, and pure water substituted. The
washing must be repeated as in the former process until
all the remains of crystals or acid are removed, when the
specimens may be preserved in small phials as stated above.</p>

<p>Such are the usual modes of treating the Diatomaceæ,
but there are certain cases in which particular methods are
required to give anything like perfect results. Persons of
great experience combine a variety of treatments, and thus
obtain better and more uniform specimens. Perhaps it will
be advantageous to give the young student the process
adopted by one of the most successful preparers of these
objects; but I will first state the different methods of
mounting the cleaned diatoms dry: how to employ Canada
balsam and fluid in their preservation will be elsewhere
described.</p>

<p>It was before stated that the diatoms when cleansed
might be preserved in small phials of distilled water.
When required for mounting, shake the phial, and with a
thin glass tube or rod take up a drop of the fluid and spread
it upon the surface of the slide in the desired position.
This must then be allowed to dry gradually, or by the aid of
the lamp if necessary, without being shaken or interfered
with, otherwise uniformity of dispersion will be prevented.
When <em>thoroughly</em> dry, a thin ring of one of the adhesive
varnishes—gold-size will be found as good as any—may be
drawn round the diatoms, and allowed to dry in a slight
degree. The slide and thin glass cover should then be
warmed and the latter gently pressed upon the ring of
varnish until the adhesion all round is complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
As some of the diatoms require object-glasses of extremely
high power, and, consequently, short focus, to show
them, they must be as close to the outer surface of the cover
as possible. For this reason they are sometimes placed
upon the under side of the thin glass, as follows. Clean the
surfaces of the slide and cover, and with the rod or pipe
place the liquid containing the diatoms upon the thin glass,
and dry as before. Trace the ring to receive the cover
upon the slide, and when almost dry, warm both and proceed
as above. Whichever of these methods is employed, the
outer ring of coloured varnish may be applied as elsewhere
described and the slide finished.</p>

<p>The diatoms are also sometimes mounted betwixt two
thin glasses, as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>, so that the light by
which they are examined may receive as little interference
as possible, and that an achromatic condenser may be
brought into focus under the slide.</p>

<p>Of the various modes of cleaning and mounting the
Diatomaceæ, I believe that the following may be safely
recommended as affording results of the very best quality.
My friend, Mr. T. G. Rylands, gave it to me as that which
he prefers, and I can safely say that his numerous slides are
at least equal to any I have ever seen. I will give it just
as I received it from him, though there may be some little
repetition of what has been said elsewhere, as he does not
appropriate any part of it as his own. He says:—In this
branch of mounting, general rules alone can be laid down,
because the gatherings may contain iron, lime, fine silt, or
vegetable matter under conditions for special treatment, and
consequently the first step should be to experiment on
various kinds.</p>

<p>In gathering diatoms much labour is saved by judgment and
care; hence it is desirable to get acquainted with them in their
growing condition, so that when recognised upon the sands
or other spots they may be carefully removed by the aid of
the spoon or small tin scoop before described. When growing
upon algæ or other plants, the plants and diatoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
together may be carried home, in which case they must be
simply drained and not washed or pressed, in order that the
diatoms be not lost. As it is always desirable to examine
the gathering on the ground, a “Gairdner’s hand microscope”
with powers from 80 to 200 diameters will be found very
useful. The best gatherings are those which represent one
species abundantly. Those which are mixed may be rejected,
unless they are seen to contain something valuable or important,
as the object should be not so much to supply
microscopical curiosities as to collect material which is
available for the study of nature.</p>

<p>The gathering when carried home should always be
carefully examined before anything is done with it; not
only on account of the additional information thus acquired,
but also because it often happens that a specimen should
be mounted in fluid (see <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>) in the condition in
which it is gathered, as well as cleaned and mounted in
balsam (<a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>) and dry.</p>

<p>Where the gathering is taken from sand, the whole may
be shaken up in water as a preliminary operation, when
much of the sand will be separated by its own weight.
The lime test, however, should be applied, viz.—a small
portion of hydrochloric acid, and if there be effervescence
it must be dissolved out by this means. From Algæ and
other weeds diatoms may be detached by agitating the
whole together in a weak solution of nitric acid—about one
of pure acid to twenty or thirty of water, as it must be
sufficiently weak to free the diatoms without destroying the
matter to which they adhere. The diatoms may then be
separated by sifting through coarse muslin, which will retain
the Algæ, &amp;c. The process of cleaning will vary according
to circumstances. Some gatherings require to be boiled
only a few minutes in nitric acid; but the more general
plan where they are mixed with organic or other foreign
matter, is to boil them in pure sulphuric acid until they
cease to grow darker in colour (usually from a half to one
minute), and then to add, drop by drop to avoid explosions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
a cold saturated solution of chlorate of potash until the
colour is discharged, or, in case the colour does not disappear,
the quantity of the solution used is at least equal
to that of the acid. This operation is best performed in a
wide-mouthed ordinary beaker glass,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> a test-tube being too
narrow. The mixture whilst boiling should be poured into
thirty times its bulk of cold water, and the whole allowed
to subside. The fluid must then be carefully decanted and
the vessel re-supplied once or twice with pure water, so as
to get rid of all the acid. The gathering may then be
transferred to a small boiling glass or test-tube, and—the
water being carefully decanted—boiled in the smallest
available quantity of nitric acid, and washed as before.
This last process has been found necessary from the frequent
appearance of minute crystals, which cannot otherwise
be readily disposed of without the loss of a considerable
proportion of diatoms.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> These glasses are round, about six inches high, and usually contain
about eight ounces. They are rather wider at the bottom, tapering
gradually to the top, and may be generally procured at the chemists, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>I may here mention that the washing glasses used by
Mr. Rylands are stoppered conical bottles varying in
capacity from two ounces to one quart; the conical form
being employed to prevent the adherence of anything to
the side; they are “stoppered” to render them available in
the shaking process about to be described.</p>

<p>The gathering, freed from acid, is now put into two inches
depth of water, shaken vigorously for a minute or two, and
allowed to subside for half an hour, after which the turbid
fluid must be carefully decanted. This operation must be
repeated until all the matter is removed which will not
settle in half an hour. The fluid removed should be examined
by a drop being put upon a slide, as in some cases
very light diatoms have been found to come off almost
pure in one or more of these earlier washings. The quantity
of water and time of subsidence given may be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
generally, but may require to be modified according to
circumstances and the judgment of the operator. By the
repetition and variation of this process—the <em>shaking</em> being
the most important part—the gathering, if a <em>pure</em> one, will
be sufficiently clean. If, however, it contains a variety of
species and forms, it may require to be divided into <em>different
densities</em>.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it is best to divide the gathering
as a <em>preliminary</em> operation, which may be done by agitating
it in a quantity of water and decanting what does not
readily subside. The heavier and the lighter portions are
then to be treated as two separate boilings. But when the
cleansing has been carried to the above stage and this
division is required, the plan must be somewhat as follows:—The
gathering must be shaken in a test-tube with six
inches of water, and then allowed to subside until one inch
at the top remains pure. About three inches are then to
be carefully withdrawn by a pipette, when the tube may be
filled up and the operation repeated. The three lower
inches also may then be decanted and examined. The
gathering is thus divided into three portions, viz.—that
which was withdrawn by the pipette, that which remained
floating in the lower three inches of water in the tube, and
that which had settled at the bottom. An examination of
these will inform the operator how to obtain that particular
density of gathering which he desires, and how far it is
worth while to refine this process of elutriation; for in
cases of necessity any one, or all three, of these densities
may be operated upon in the same way to separate a
particular diatom.</p>

<p>As occasional aids, it may be remarked, that in some cases
<em>liquor ammoniæ</em> may be used in place of water, as it often
separates fine dirt, which is not otherwise easily got rid
of. Some fossil deposits require to be treated with a boiling
solution of carbonate of soda to disintegrate them; but this
operation requires great care, lest the alkali should destroy
the diatoms. Vegetable silicates also sometimes require to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
be removed by a solution of carbonate of soda; but as the
frustules of the diatoms themselves are but <em>vegetable silica</em>,
even more care is required in this case. It may be well
to mention, that some diatoms are so imperfectly siliceous
that they will not bear <em>boiling</em> in acid at all. Some of
these may be allowed to stand in cold nitric acid some time,
whilst others of a smaller and more delicate character
should, when possible, be treated with distilled water
alone.</p>

<p>We will now consider the mode of mounting the prepared
diatoms, which, if used dry (as described in this chapter),
should be carefully washed two or three times with the
purest distilled water. In this branch, as in every other,
each collector gives preference to that method in which he
is an adept. Thus the diatoms may be placed on the
under side of the cover, to be as near to the object-glass
as possible, or upon the slide itself; and each plan has
its advocates. Whichsoever of these is used, nothing seems
more simple to the novice than a tolerably equal dispersion
of the objects upon the slide or cover; but this is by no
means so readily accomplished, consequently I give Mr.
Rylands’ method, as his slides are perfect in this respect
also. He always places the diatoms upon the thin glass
cover. It is not sufficient, as is frequently thought, to
take a drop of liquid containing the cleansed material and
spread it upon the cover or slide, as without some additional
precaution that uniform and regular distribution of the
specimens is not obtained which is desirable. In order to
effect this, let a drop of the cleansed gathering be diluted
sufficiently for the purpose—how much must be determined
in each case by experiment—and let the covers to be
mounted be cleaned and laid upon the brass plate. (See
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>) By means of a glass tube, about one-twelfth of
an inch in diameter, stopped by the wetted finger at the
upper end, take up as much of the diluted material as will
form a moderately convex drop extending over the whole
cover. When all the covers required are thus prepared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
apply a lamp below the brass plate, and raise the temperature
to a point just short of boiling. By this means
the covers will be dried in a few minutes, and the specimens
equally distributed over the whole area. The spread of
the fluid upon the covers is facilitated by breathing upon
them; and, to insure uniformity, care must be taken to
avoid shaking them whilst drying. The best plan is to
mount at least half a dozen at once.</p>

<p>Before mounting, Mr. Rylands always burns the diatoms
upon the glass at a dull red heat, whether they are used
with balsam or dry. This burning, he says, is not only
an additional cleaning process, but it effectually fixes the
diatoms, and prevents them floating out if mounted
with balsam. The thinnest covers may be burnt without
damage if they are placed upon a small piece of
platinum foil of the size required, which should be about
one-hundredth of an inch thick, perfectly flat, and having
three of its edges slightly bent over, so as to prevent its
warping with the heat. The small flame of a spirit-lamp,
or, where there is gas, a Bunsen’s burner, may be employed.
The cover should be shaded from direct daylight, that the
action of the flame may be observed more perfectly. Care
must then be taken to raise the temperature only to the
dull red heat before mentioned. The cover will then be
in a fit state for mounting as required.</p>

<p>It has been stated in another place that it is assumed
the operator is not mounting diatoms simply as microscopic
objects, but as instructive specimens. It is not, therefore,
sufficient to take a single slide as all that is required, but
to have the same diatom prepared in as many ways as
possible. The following are the <span class="locked">principal:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Mounted crude in fluid (see <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>).</p>

<p>2. Burnt crude upon the cover, and mounted dry or in
balsam (as before mentioned).</p>

<p>3. Mounted dry or in balsam (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>), after
the cleansing process already described.</p></blockquote>

<p>I will here give Mr. Rylands’ method of mounting them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
<em>dry</em>, the fluid and balsam preparations being noticed in their
respective chapters. The slide with the ring of asphalt,
or black varnish, should have been prepared some weeks
previously, in order to allow it to dry thoroughly. When
required, it must be held over the spirit-lamp or Bunsen’s
burner until the ring of varnish is softened. The burnt
cover, having been heated at the same time, must then be
taken in the forceps and pressed upon the softened varnish
until it adheres all round. When cold, an outer ring of
asphalt completes the slide.</p>

<p>Such is the method which my friend Mr. T. G. Rylands
employs in the preparation of diatoms for the microscope.
I have said enough concerning his results. It is to be
feared, however, that to some these several modes of operation
may appear lengthy and complicated; but if read
carefully, and the experiments tried, they will be found
simple enough in practice, and to occupy much less time
than an intelligible description would lead the novice to
believe necessary.</p>

<p>One of the most fertile as well as the most curious magazines
of Diatomaceæ is <em>guano</em>. The siliceous forms contained
therein have been devoured by sea-birds and passed through
the stomach uninjured, and after lying for ages may be
cleaned and classified. Many of these are not elsewhere
met with, so that the student who is desirous to enter into
the study of Diatomaceæ must be instructed as to the best
mode of obtaining them from this source. The particulars
to be observed so closely resemble those before mentioned
in the treatment of the ordinary diatoms, that it will be
sufficiently explicit to give the outlines of the process. The
guano must be first washed in pure water, allowed to subside
perfectly, and the liquid then poured off. This must
be repeated until the top fluid is clear, and care taken not
to decant the liquid until perfect subsidence has taken
place. The deposit must then be treated with hydrochloric
acid with a gentle heat for an hour or two, adding a little
fresh acid at intervals as long as it excites any effervescence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
After this nitric acid must be substituted for the hydrochloric,
and the heat kept up to almost boiling-point for
another hour at least, adding a little fresh acid as before.
When this ceases to act, the deposit must be allowed to
settle perfectly and the acid poured off. All traces of the
acid must now be washed away with pure water, when the
remains will be Diatomaceæ, the sand contained in the
guano, and a few other forms. Some of these may be
mounted dry, as before mentioned, but the greater portion
should be put up in Canada balsam as described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>Such is the ordinary method for the treatment of guano;
but Mr. Rylands’ mode of proceeding with ordinary Diatomaceæ
(before given) will be found equally successful with
these deposits.</p>

<p>The fossil Infusoria (as they were formerly called) are now
termed Diatomaceæ, and are found in various parts of the
world—“Bermuda earth,” “Berg-mehl” from Norway, deposit
from Mourne Mountain in Ireland, &amp;c. They are found in
immense quantities, and afford the microscopist innumerable
objects. The same treatment as that usually employed for
the Diatomaceæ must be followed with these deposits, but
as they are sometimes obtained in hard masses, disintegration
is first necessary. To effect this, they are usually boiled
for a short time in diluted <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liquor potassæ</i>, which will soon
cause the mass to fall into a mud-like deposit. Water
must then be immediately added, in order that all further
action of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liquor potassæ</i> may be stopped, otherwise the
objects searched for will be dissolved. For this reason it is
necessary to understand what substance is being dealt with,
because some deposits are much finer and acted upon more
readily than others.</p>

<p>In mounting these objects, some are so delicate that they
are almost invisible when balsam is used with them; they
are therefore usually mounted <em>dry</em>. Others, however, are
much coarser, and may be mounted in balsam like the Diatomaceæ
mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
The common Infusoria cannot be mounted dry with any
great success, though a few may be placed upon the glass
slide and allowed to dry naturally, when their characters
will be very well shown. To obtain anything like a natural
appearance, they must be put up in fluid as in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a></p>

<p>Next to the Diatomaceæ, no class of microscopic objects has
been more looked into of late than the Foraminifera. These
animals are almost all marine, having a jelly-like body enclosed
in one or more chambers of shell generally composed of
carbonate of lime. The shells are made with minute orifices,
through which the pseudopodia (false feet) are extended by
which the animal is enabled to lay hold of anything and
draw itself along. From the possession of these orifices
they derive their name, as <em>foramen</em> means a door or opening.
They have been found in every depth of sea hitherto
sounded, each depth being abundant in certain species; the
lowest beds containing the greatest number of specimens,
though with less variation of kinds. In chalk they are found
in a fossil state, and may readily be shown (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter
III.</a>); in limestone and other hard stones they are abundant,
and some mountains are composed principally of these
shells.</p>

<p>The methods of obtaining Foraminifera are various. Many
may be found upon seaweeds, which should always be examined
as soon as possible after gathering. They are found
in masses upon some coasts where the waves have carried
and left them; but they are to be found the most abundantly
in sand or mud dredged from the bottom of the sea. They
must, however, be cleansed and separated from the mass of
impurity with which they are usually mixed. This may be
done in various ways, according to the nature of the accompanying
matter. If sand alone, as is frequently the case,
the whole mass must be <em>thoroughly</em> dried, and then stirred
up in clean water. The sand will soon subside by its own
weight, but the chambers of the Foraminifera, being filled
with air, will float upon the surface, and may be skimmed
off. There is, however, one objection to this mode of proceeding—some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of these objects are so minute, the chambers
containing comparatively so small a quantity of air, that they
sink and are cast away with the refuse sand. On this
account it is preferable to take the trouble of searching
certain soundings under the microscope, using the camel-hair
pencil, or some other contrivance before mentioned, to
extract those objects which are required. To clean the
Foraminifera, Professor Williamson advises to transfer the
specimens to an evaporating dish containing a weak solution
of caustic potash. This must be boiled for “some
moments,” when the organic matter will be entirely dissolved,
and the calcareous shells left free from impurity. They
must now be well washed in water, so that all alkaline
matter may be entirely got rid of.</p>

<p>If the specimens are in <em>mud</em>, we must proceed in a different
way:—Stir up the whole mass in water, and allow
it to stand until the heavier portion has sunk to the bottom;
the water may then be poured off and examined to see if
there are any objects contained in it. This process must
be repeated until the water comes off quite clear, when (if
the search is for Foraminifera only) the solution of caustic
potash may be used as before mentioned. However the
soundings, &amp;c., are cleaned, it is necessary to assort them
under the microscope with the camel-hair pencil or other contrivance,
as it is impossible to obtain them fit for mounting
without undergoing this process.</p>

<p>The sea soundings taken by order of Government are
drawn from the bottom in a kind of apparatus ingeniously
made for the purpose, and the sand, mud, &amp;c., are brought
up in their original state. Common soundings, however,
are taken by lowering a heavy piece of lead coated with
tallow, which consequently brings up a small portion of the
matter from the bottom. Mr. George Mosley, the late
Secretary of the Manchester Microscopic Society, obtained
numbers of the “scrapings” from the sounding leads. To
make any use of these it is, of course, necessary to free them
from all traces of the tallow. Mr. Dancer places the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
sounding in a basin and pours boiling water upon it, which
causes the melted grease to rise to the surface. When
cold, this may be removed, and the water carefully decanted.
The operation may be repeated until no grease appears,
when the water may be withdrawn and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liquor ammoniæ</i>
used, which will form a soapy solution with any remaining
grease. This must be treated with hot water for the final
washing. Care must be taken lest the finer forms be carried
away in decanting the washing liquid. Should it be wished
to make certain as to this point, each washing should be
examined under the microscope. In some cases the process
of Mr. Dancer will prove sufficient. Mr. Dale, however,
gives a method of accomplishing the same result, which is
much more readily completed; and as the results cannot
be found fault with, I will here give it in full:—It is now
well known that one of the products obtained from the
naphtha of coal-tar is a volatile, oily substance, termed
<em>benzole</em> (or, by French chemists, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">benzine</i>), whose boiling-point,
when pure, is about 180° Fahrenheit, which is a
perfect solvent for fatty substances. In a capsule, previously
warmed on a sand-bath, Mr. Dale mixes with the
tallow soundings benzole, whose boiling-point may be about
200°, until sufficiently diluted so as to run freely, pressing
the lumps with a glass rod until thoroughly mingled; the
solution and its contents are then poured into a paper
filter, placed in a glass funnel; the capsule is again washed
with benzole, until the whole of the gritty particles are
removed into the filter. A washing-bottle is then supplied
with benzole, and the contents of the filter washed to the
bottom until that liquid passes off pure, which may be
tested by placing a drop from the point of the funnel on a
warm slip of glass or bright platinum, when, if pure, the
benzole will evaporate without residue or tarnish; if grease
be present, the washings must be continued until they are
free from it. After rinsing through <em>weak</em> acid, or alcohol,
for final purification, the calcareous forms will be ready for
mounting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
The filter and its contents may be left to dry spontaneously,
when the latter can be examined by the microscope.
Should time be an object, rapid drying may be
effected by any of the usual methods; one of which,
recommended by Mr. Dale, is to blow a stream of hot air
through a glass tube held in the flame of a Bunsen’s burner.
The lower the boiling-point of the benzole, the more readily
can the specimens be freed from it. A commoner quality
may be used, but it is more difficult to dry afterwards.</p>

<p>Pure benzole being costly, this may appear an expensive
process; but, with the exception of a trifling loss by
evaporation, the whole may be recovered by simple distillation.
The mixture of tallow and benzole being placed
in a retort in a hot-water, a steam, or a sand bath, the
benzole will pass into the receiver, and the tallow or other
impurities will remain in the retort. When the whole of
the benzole has distilled over, which is ascertained by its
ceasing to drop from the condenser, the heat is withdrawn
and the retort allowed to cool before the addition of fresh
material. Half a dozen to a dozen filters, each with its
specimen, can be in process at the same time; and the distillation
of the recovered benzole progresses as quickly as
the filtration, which was practically proved on the occasion
named. Great caution in the use of benzole is to be taken
in the approach of lights to the inflammable vapour.</p>

<p>After the Foraminifera and calcareous forms have been
removed, the residue may be treated with acids and levigation
in the usual manner, to obtain siliceous forms and
discs, if there are any present; but to facilitate their
deposition, and to avoid the loss of any minute atoms
suspended in the washings, I would suggest the use of
filtration. The conical filter is unsuitable, as the particles
would spread over too great a surface of paper; but glass
tubes open at both ends (such as broken test-tubes) will be
found to answer, the broad end covered with filtering paper,
and over that a slip of muslin tied on with a thread to
facilitate the passage of the water and prevent the risk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
breaking the paper. Suspend the tube over a suitable
vessel through a hole cut in thin wood or cardboard, pour
in the washings which can be thus filtered and then dried.
The cloth must be carefully removed, the paper cut round
the edges of the tube, and the diatoms on the paper disc
may be removed by a camel-hair pencil or otherwise, ready
for mounting. Thus many objects may be preserved which
would be either washed away or only be obtained by a more
tedious process.</p>

<p>Such is Mr. Dale’s method of cleaning the soundings
from the tallow, and as it thoroughly accomplishes its end,
and is alike effective and not injurious to Foraminifera and
diatoms, it may be safely recommended. The weak solution
of caustic potash before advised for Foraminifera, must not
be used where it is desired to preserve the diatoms, as they
would certainly be injured, or destroyed altogether, if this
agent were employed.</p>

<p>In fixing the Foraminifera upon the slide, no better plan
can be followed than the “dry cells” and gum recommended
in the early parts of this chapter. Owing to their thickness
and composition, most of them are opaque objects only; but
they are exquisitely beautiful, and require no particular care,
except in allowing the cell, &amp;c., to be perfectly dry, when
the cover is placed upon it, or the damp will certainly
become condensed upon the inner side, and the examination
seriously interfered with.</p>

<p>Many of the Foraminifera require cutting into sections if
it is wished to examine the internal structure, &amp;c.,—“decalcifying”
is also desirable in some cases;—both of these processes
will be found described at length in the chapter on
Sections and Dissection.</p>

<p>When more than one specimen of some particular shell
is obtained, it is better to place them upon the slide in different
positions, so as to show as much of the structure as
possible. I will conclude this subject by quoting a passage
from T. Rymer Jones:—“It is, therefore, by no means sufficient
to treat these shells as ordinary objects by simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
laying them on a glass slide, so as to see them only from one
or two points of view; they must be carefully examined in
every direction, for such is the diversity of form that nothing
short of this will be at all satisfactory. For this purpose,
they should be attached to the point of a fine needle, so that
they may be turned in any direction, and examined by
reflected light condensed upon them by means of a lens or
side reflector. In many of the thick-shelled species it will
be necessary to grind them down on a hone [see <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a>]
before the number and arrangement of the internal chambers
is discernible; and in order to investigate satisfactorily the
minutiæ of their structure, a variety of sections, made in
various ways, is indispensable.”</p>

<p>Plants afford an almost inexhaustible treasury for the
microscope, and many of them show their beauties best when
mounted dry. When any of these also are to be mounted,
care must be taken that they are thoroughly dry, otherwise
the damp will certainly arise in the cell, and injure the
object; and it may be here mentioned that long after a leaf
has every appearance of dryness, the interior is still damp,
and no way can be recommended of getting rid of this by
any quicker process than that effected by keeping them in a
warm room, as many leaves, &amp;c., are utterly spoiled by using
a hot iron or other contrivance. The safest way is to press
them gently betwixt blotting-paper, which may be removed
and dried at short intervals; and though this may appear a
tedious operation, it is a <em>safe</em> one.</p>

<p>On the surface of the leaves, hairs and scales of various
and very beautiful forms are found, most of which display
their beauties best when removed from the leaf, and used with
the polarizer. These will be noticed in another place; but
a portion of the leaf should always be prepared in its natural
form, to show the arrangement of the hair or scales upon it;
which must almost invariably be mounted dry when used for
this purpose. Many of them require very delicate handling.
The <em>epidermis</em>, or, as it is by some termed, the <em>cuticle</em>, is
the outer skin which lies upon the surface of the leaves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
other parts of most plants. This is composed of cells closely
connected, often bearing the appearance of a rude network.
In many plants, by scraping up the surface of the leaf, a
thin coating is detached, which may be torn off by taking
hold of it with the forceps. The piece may then be washed
and floated upon a glass slide, where, on drying, it will be
firmly fixed, and may usually be mounted dry. Amongst
the most beautiful and easily prepared of these may be
mentioned the petal of the geranium, the cells of which are
well defined and amongst the most interesting.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the leaves are the <span class="smcap smaller">ANTHERS</span> and
<span class="smcap smaller">POLLEN</span>, of which a great number are beautiful and interesting
subjects for the microscopist.</p>

<p>The mallow tribe will furnish some exquisite objects,
bearing the appearance of masses of costly jewels. These
are usually dried with pressure, but the natural form
may be more accurately preserved by allowing them to
dry as they are taken from the flower, with no interference
except thoroughly protecting them from all dust. Sometimes
the anther is divided, so that the cell required to
receive them may be of as little depth as possible. The
common mallow is a beautiful object, but I think the
lavatera is a better, as it shows the pollen chambers well,
when dried unpressed. The pollen is often set alone, and is
well worth the trouble, as it then admits of more close examination.
Often it is convenient to have the <em>anther and
pollen</em> as seen in nature on one slide, and the <em>pollen</em> alone
upon another. The former should be taken from the
flowers before their full development is attained, as if overgrown
they lose much of their beauty. Some pollens are
naturally so dark that it is necessary to mount them in
Canada balsam or fluid, as described in other places; but
they are better mounted dry when they are not too opaque.</p>

<p>Here, too, we may also mention the <span class="smcap smaller">SEEDS</span> of many plants
as most interesting, and some of them very beautiful, objects,
requiring for the greater part but a low power to show
them. Most of these are to be mounted dry, as opaque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
objects, in cells suited to them, but some are best seen in
balsam, and will be mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Corallines</span>, many of which are found on almost every
coast, afford some very valuable objects for the microscope.
They must be well washed when first procured, to get rid of
all the salts in the sea-water, dried and mounted in cells deep
enough to protect them from all danger of pressure, as some
of them are exceedingly fragile. The white ivory appearance
which some of them present is given to them by an
even covering of carbonate of lime; and should it be desired
to examine the structure of these more closely, it may be
accomplished by keeping them for some time in vinegar
or dilute muriatic acid, which will remove the lime and allow
of the substance being sliced in the same way as other Algæ.
(“Micrographic Dictionary,” p. 183.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Scales of Insects.</span>—The fine dust upon the wings
of moths and butterflies, which is so readily removed when
handled carelessly, is what is generally called <em>scales</em>. To
these the wing owes the magnificent colours which so
often are seen upon it; every particle being what may be
termed a distinct flat feather. How these are placed (somewhat
like tiles upon a roof) may be easily seen in the wing
of any butterfly, a few being removed to aid the investigation.
The form of them is usually that of the
“battledore” with which the common game is played, but
the handle or base of the scale is often short, and the broad
part varies in proportionate length and breadth in different
specimens. The markings upon these also vary, some being
mostly composed of lines running from the base to the apex,
others reminding us of network—bead-like spots only are
seen in some—indeed, almost endless changes are found
amongst them. These scales are not confined to butterflies
and moths, nor indeed to the <em>wings</em> of insects. The different
gnats supply some most beautiful specimens, not only from
the wings, but also from the proboscis, &amp;c.; whilst from
still more minute insects, as the podura, scales are taken
which were at one time esteemed as a most delicate test.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
The gorgeous colours which the diamond beetles also show
when under the microscope are produced by light reflected
from minute scales with which the insects are covered.</p>

<p>In mounting these objects for the microscope it is well to
have the part of the insect from which the scales are usually
taken as a separate slide, so that the natural arrangement
of them may be seen. This is easily accomplished with
the wings of butterflies, gnats, &amp;c.; as they require no
extraordinary care. In mounting the <em>scales</em> they may be
placed upon slides, by passing the wings over the surface,
or by gently scraping the wing upon the slide, when they
must be covered with the thin glass. Of course, the extreme
tenuity of these objects does away with the necessity of any
cell excepting that formed by the gold-size or other cement
used to attach the cover. The scales of the podura should
be placed upon the slide in a somewhat different manner.
This insect is without wings, and is no longer than the
common flea. It is often found amongst the sawdust
in wine-cellars, continually leaping about by the aid of
its tail, which is bent underneath its body. Dr. Carpenter
says:—“Poduræ may be obtained by sprinkling a little oatmeal
on a piece of black paper near their haunts; and after
leaving it there for a few hours, removing it carefully
to a large glazed basin, so that, when they leap from
the paper (as they will when brought to the light), they may
fall into the basin, and may thus separate themselves from
the meal. The best way of obtaining their scales, is to
confine several of them together beneath a wine glass
inverted upon a piece of fine smooth paper; for the scales
will become detached by their leaps against the glass, and
will fall upon the paper.” These scales are removed to the
slide, and mounted as those from the gnats, &amp;c. When the
podura has been caught without the aid of the meal, it may
be placed upon the slide, under a test-tube, or by any other
mode of confinement, and thus save the trouble of transfer
from the paper before mentioned. Another method is to
seize the insect by the leg with the forceps and drag it across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the slide, when a sufficient quantity of scales will probably
be left upon it.</p>

<p>These scales are usually mounted “dry;” but Hogg
recommends the use of Canada balsam (<a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>) as
rendering their structure more definite when illuminated
with Wenham’s parabolic reflector. Some advise other
methods, which will be mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a> As most
<em>insects</em> when undissected are mounted in Canada balsam,
the different modes of treatment which they require will be
stated in another place.</p>

<p>In mounting blood of any kind to show the corpuscles,
or, as they are often called, <em>globules</em>, which are round or
oval discs, it is but necessary to cover the slide on the spot
required with a coating as thin as possible and allow it to
dry before covering with the thin glass. There is a slight
contraction in the globules when dried, but not enough to
injure them for the microscope. The shape of these varies
in different classes of animals, but the size varies much
more, some being many times as large as others.—Some
of the <em>larvæ skins</em> are beautiful objects; but, like many
sections of animal and other fragile matter, are difficult to
extend upon the slide. This difficulty is easily overcome
by floating the thin object in clear water, immersing the
slide and when the object is evenly spread gently lifting it.
Allow it then to dry by slightly raising one end of the slide
to aid the drainage, and cover with the thin glass as other objects.
The tails and fins of many small fish may be mounted
in a similar manner, and are well worth the trouble.</p>

<p>A few objects which are best shown by mounting <em>dry</em>
may be here mentioned as a slight guide to the beginner,
though some of them have been before noticed;—many
of the Foraminifera as elsewhere described. Some <em>crystals</em>
are soluble in almost any fluid or balsam, and should be
mounted <em>dry</em>; a few, however, deliquesce or effloresce, which
renders them worthless as microscopic objects.</p>

<p>The wings of butterflies and gnats, as before noticed,
afford many specimens wherewith to supply the cabinet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the young student. A great variety also may be found
amongst the ferns; indeed, these alone will afford the
student occupation for a long time. On the under-side
of the leaves are the reservoirs for the “spores,” which in
many instances somewhat resemble green velvet, and are
arranged in stripes, round masses, and other forms. The
spores are usually covered with a thin skin termed the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">indusium</i>, which is curiously marked in some specimens,
often very like pollen-grains. The manner in which
these spores with all their accompaniments are arranged,
their changes and developments afford almost endless subjects
for study; different ferns presenting us with many
variations in this respect totally invisible without the aid
of the microscope. The hymenophyllums (of which two
only belong to England) are particularly interesting, and the
structure of the leaves when dried makes them beautiful
objects, often requiring no balsam to aid their transparency.
Portions of the <em>fronds</em> of ferns should be mounted as
opaque objects, after having been dried between blotting
paper, when they are not injured by pressure; but care must
be taken to gather them at the right time, as they do not
show their beauty before they are ripe, and if over-ripe the
arrangement of the spores, &amp;c., is altered. The spores
may be mounted as separate objects in the same manner
as pollen, before-mentioned, and are exquisitely beautiful
when viewed with a tolerably high power. The number of
foreign ferns now cultivated in this country has greatly
widened the field for research in this direction; and it may
also be mentioned that the under-sides of many are found to
be covered with “scales” of very beautiful forms. A small
piece of the frond of one of these may be mounted in its
natural state, but the removal of the “scales” for examination
by polarized light will be described in another
place. The mosses also are quite a little world, requiring
but a low power to show their beauties. The leaves are of
various forms, some of which resemble beautiful net-work;
the “urns” or reservoirs for the spores, however, are perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the most interesting parts of these objects, as also of
the “liverworts” which are closely allied to the mosses.
These “urns” are generally covered by lids, which fall off
when the fruit is ripe. At this period they are well fitted
for the microscope. The common screw-moss may be found
in great abundance, and shows this denudation of the spores
very perfectly. Many of these may be easily dried without
much injury, but they should also be examined in their
natural state.</p>

<p>The student should not omit from his cabinet a leaf of
the nettle and the allied foreign species, the mystery of
which the microscope will make plain. The hairs or stings
may also be removed, and viewed with a higher power than
when on the leaf, being so transparent as to require no
balsam or other preservative.</p>

<p>There are few more interesting objects than the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">raphides</i>
or <em>plant-crystals</em>. These are far from being rare, but in
some plants they are very minute, and consequently require
care in the mounting, as well as a high magnifying power
to render them visible; in others they are so large that
about twenty-five of them placed point to point would reach
one inch. Some of these crystals are long and comparatively
very thin, which suggested the name (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">raphis</i>, a needle);
others are star-like, with long and slender rays; while
others again are of a somewhat similar form, each ray being
solid and short. If the stem of rhubarb, or almost any of
the hyacinth tribe, be bruised, so that the “juice” may flow
upon the slide, in all probability some of these crystals will
be found in the fluid. To obtain them clean, they must be
freed from all vegetable matter by maceration. After this
they must be thoroughly washed and mounted “dry.”
They are also good <em>polarizing</em> objects, giving brilliant
colours; but when used for this purpose they must be
mounted as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a> A few plants which
contain them may be mentioned here. The Cactaceæ are
very prolific; the orchids, geraniums, tulips, and the outer
coating of the onion, furnish the more unusual forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
The Fungi are generally looked upon as a very difficult
class of objects to deal with, but amongst them some of the
most available may be found. The forms of many are very
beautiful, but are so minute as to require a high magnifying
power to show them. The mould which forms on
many substances is a fungus, and in some cases may be dried
and preserved in its natural state. A friend of mine brought
me a rose-bush completely covered with a white blight.
This was found to be a fungus, which required a high magnifying
power to show it. Being a very interesting object,
it was desirable to preserve it, and this was perfectly
effected without injury to the form by simply drying the
leaf in a room usually occupied. Amongst the fungi are
many objects well worth looking for, one of which is the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Diachæa elegans</i>. This, the only species, says the “Micrographic
Dictionary,” is found in England upon the living
leaves of the lily-of-the-valley, &amp;c. These little plants grow
in masses, reminding one of mould, to a height of a quarter
of an inch, and each “stem” is covered with a sheath, in
shape somewhat like an elongated thimble. When ripe the
sheath falls off and reveals the same shaped column, made
up of beautifully fine net-work, with the spores lying here
and there. This dries well, and is a good object for the
middle powers. Amongst the fungi the blights of wheat
and of other articles of food may be included. Many of them
may be mounted “dry;” others, however, cannot be well
preserved except in liquids, and will be referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter
IV.</a> Amongst the zoophytes and sea-mats, commonly
called “sea-weeds,” may be found many very interesting
objects to be mounted “dry.” When this mode of preservation
is used, it is necessary that all the sea-salt be
thoroughly washed from them. As they are, however, most
frequently mounted in balsam or liquid, they will be more
fully noticed in other places.</p>

<p>The <em>scales of fishes</em> are generally mounted “dry” when
used as ordinary objects; but for polarized light, balsam or
liquid must be used, as noticed in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a> The variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and beauty of these are quite surprising to the novice.
It is also very interesting to procure the skin of the fish
when possible, and mount it on a separate slide to show
how the scales are arranged. The sole is one of the most
unusual forms, the projecting end of each scale being covered
with spines, which radiate from a common centre, while
those at the extremity are carried out somewhat resembling
the rays of a star. One of the skates has a spine projecting
from the centre of each scale, which is a very curious
opaque object, especially when the skin is mounted in the
manner described. The perch, roach, minnow, and others
of the common fishes give the student good objects for his
cabinet, and may be procured without difficulty.</p>

<p>Insects which are very transparent, or have the
“metallic lustre” with which any medium would interfere,
are mounted “dry.” The diamond-beetle, before mentioned,
is a splendid example of this; the back is generally used,
but the legs, showing the curious feet, are very interesting
objects. Indeed, amongst the legs and feet of insects there
is a wide field of interest. When they are of a “horny”
nature, it is best to dry them in any form preferred, but to
use no pressure; when, however, they are wanted flat, so as
to show the feet, &amp;c., extended, they must be dried with
a gentle pressure betwixt blotting-paper if possible. But
this will be treated more fully in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>The <em>eyes of insects</em> are sometimes allowed to dry in their
natural shape, and mounted as opaque objects; but
generally they are used as transparencies in balsam or
liquid, so the description of the treatment which they
require will be deferred to <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>Hairs, when not too dark, are sometimes transparent
enough when mounted dry, but are usually mounted in
balsam. These also will be more fully noticed in another
place.</p>

<p>These are a few of the objects which are often mounted
dry, but some of them should be shown in balsam or liquid
also, and there is much difference of opinion as to the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
way of preserving others. This, however, is explained by
the transparency which the balsam gives interfering with
one property of the object and yet developing another
which would have remained invisible if preserved dry. The
only method of overcoming this difficulty is to keep the
object mounted in both ways, which is comparatively little
trouble.</p>

<p>I may here mention that many prefer the lieberkuhn
for the illumination of opaque objects; and a good background
is gained by putting upon the under side of the
slide, immediately beneath the object, a spot of black
varnish, which does not interfere materially with the light.</p>

<span class="subhead">MOUNTING IN CANADA BALSAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> nature and use of this substance has been before spoken
of, so the method of working with it may be at once described.</p>

<p>Perfect dryness of the objects is, if possible, more necessary
in this mode of mounting than any other, as dampness
remaining in the object will assuredly cause a cloudiness to
make its appearance in a short time after it is fixed. Where
pressure does not injure the specimens, they are most successfully
treated when first dried betwixt the leaves of a
book, or in any other way which may prove most convenient,
as noticed in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>Before describing the methods of proceeding with any
particular objects, general rules may be given which should
be observed in order to succeed in this branch of mounting.</p>

<p>As the object is to be thoroughly immersed in the balsam,
it is evident that when it has once been covered, so
it must remain, unless we again free it by a process hereafter
mentioned, which is very troublesome; and on this
account there must be nothing whatever in the balsam
except the object. The inexperienced may think this an
unnecessary caution; but the greatest difficulty he will meet
with is to get rid of minute bubbles of air, perhaps invisible
to the naked eye, which appear like small globules when
under the microscope, and render the slide unsightly, or even
worthless. Ten objects out of eleven contain air, or at least
are full of minute holes which are necessarily filled with it;
so that if they should be immersed in any liquid of thick
consistency, these cells of air would be imprisoned, and
become <em>bubbles</em>. The air, then, must be got rid of, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
is usually accomplished by soaking for some time in turpentine,
the period required differing according to the nature of
the object. In some cases, the turpentine acts upon the
colour, or even removes it altogether, so that it must be
watched carefully. Often, however, this is an advantage, as
where the structure alone is wanted, the removal of the
colouring matter renders it more transparent. There are
objects, however, which retain the air with such tenacity
that soaking alone will not remove it. If these will bear
heat without being injured, they <em>may</em> be boiled in turpentine,
or even in balsam, when the air will be partly or totally
expelled. But where heat is objectionable, they must be
immersed in the turpentine, and so submitted to the action
of the air-pump. Even with this aid, sometimes days are
required to accomplish it perfectly, during which time the
air should be exhausted at intervals of five or six hours, if
convenient, and the objects turned over now and then.</p>

<p>Sometimes the objects are so minute that it is impossible
to submit them to any soaking, and in this case they must
be laid upon the slide at once, and the turpentine applied to
them there. But it must not be forgotten that there are
some few which are much better mounted in such a way
that the balsam may thoroughly surround, and yet not
<em>penetrate</em>, the substance more than necessary. Sections of
teeth are amongst these, which will be noticed in another
place, and some insects (see Dr. Carpenter) when required
to show the “ramifications of the tracheæ.”</p>

<p>Having freed the object, then, from these two enemies—dampness
and air—we must proceed to mount it.</p>

<p>The slide must first be cleaned; then on the centre a
quantity of balsam must be placed with a bluntly-pointed
glass rod, according to the size of the object about to be
mounted. To this a slight heat must be applied, which will
cause any bubbles to rise from the surface of the slide, so
that they may be readily removed with a needle. The object
should be freed from all air by steeping in turpentine, as
before described, and then from superfluous liquid by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
short drainage, and carefully laid <em>upon</em>, or where it is practicable
thrust <em>into</em>, the balsam, prepared on the slide as
above. In the former case, or where the balsam has not
totally covered the object, a small quantity must be taken,
warmed, and dropped upon it, and any bubbles removed by
the needle as before. To cover this, the thin glass must be
warmed, and beginning at one side, allowed to fall upon the
balsam, driving a small “wave” before it, and thus expelling
any bubbles which may remain. This is quite as safely
performed (if not more so) by making a solution of balsam
in turpentine of the consistency of thick varnish. The thin
glass cover may be slightly coated with this, and will then
be much less liable to imprison any air, which frequently
happens when the cover is dry. Bubbles, however, will
sometimes make their appearance in spite of all care; but
when the object is comparatively strong, they may be
removed by keeping the slide rather warm, and <em>working</em> the
cover a little, so as to press them to one side, when they
should be immediately removed with a needle point, otherwise
they are again drawn under.</p>

<p>Where the slide requires keeping warm for any length of
time, a <em>hot-water bath</em> is sometimes made use of, which is
simply a flat tin, or other metal case, with a mouth at the
side, that when the hot water is introduced it may be
closed up, and so retain its warmth for a long time. In
working, the slide is laid upon it, and so admits of longer
operations, when required, without growing cold. Sometimes
a spirit-lamp is placed under it to keep up an equal heat
through excessively long processes. Where the time required,
however, is but short, a thick brass plate is sometimes used
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>), which is heated to any degree that is
required, and the slide placed upon it.</p>

<p>Some objects, which are so thin that they are usually
<em>floated</em> upon the slide, as before stated, require no steeping in
turpentine or other liquid. These are best mounted by
covering with a little <em>diluted</em> balsam, and after this
has had time to penetrate the substance, ordinary balsam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
is laid upon it, and the slide finished in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>I have stated that the balsam is usually applied to the
slide and objects with a “bluntly-pointed glass rod;” but
for the purpose of drawing the balsam from the bottle, and
conveying it to the desired place, Dr. Carpenter uses a glass
syringe with a <em>free</em> opening. These are his instructions:—“This
(the syringe) is most readily filled with balsam, in
the first instance, by drawing out the piston, and pouring in
balsam previously rendered more liquid by gentle warmth;
and nothing else is required to enable the operator at any
time to expel precisely the amount of balsam he may require,
than to warm the point of the syringe, if the balsam should
have hardened in it, and to apply a very gentle heat to the
syringe generally, if the piston should not then be readily
pressed down. When a number of balsam objects are being
mounted at one time, the advantage of this plan in regard
to facility and cleanliness (no superfluous balsam being
deposited on the slide) will make itself sensibly felt.”</p>

<p>When the “mounting” is thus far accomplished, the
outer “wall” of balsam may be roughly removed after a
few hours have elapsed; but great care is necessary lest the
cover be moved or interfered with in any way. In this
state it may be left for the final cleansing until the balsam
becomes hard, which takes place sooner or later, according
to the degree of warmth it has been subjected to. A
mantel-piece, or some place about equal to it in temperature,
is the best suited to this purpose; and when the requisite
hardness is attained, it may be proceeded with as follows:—With
a pointed knife the balsam must be scraped away,
taking care that the thin glass be not cracked by the point
getting <em>under</em> it. If used carefully, the knife will render the
slide almost clean; but any minute portions which still
adhere to the glass must be rubbed with linen dipped in
turpentine or spirit. If the balsam is not very hard, these
small fragments are readily removed by folding a piece of
paper tightly in a triangular form with many folds, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
damping the point with which the glass is rubbed. As the
paper becomes worn with the friction, the balsam will be
carried off with it. In some cases I have found this simple
expedient very useful.</p>

<p>Sometimes the object to be mounted is of such a thickness
as to require a cell. For this purpose glass rings are used
(as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>), and filled with balsam. The
best mode of doing this is thus described by Mr. T. S.
Ralph in the <cite>Microscopic Journal</cite>:—“The question was
asked me when I was in England, if I knew how to fill a
cell with Canada balsam and leave behind no air-bubbles?
I replied in the negative; but now I can state how to accomplish
this. Fill the cell with clear spirit of turpentine,
place the specimen in it, have ready some balsam just
fluid enough to flow out of the bottle when warmed by the
hand; pour this on the object at one end, and, gradually
inclining the slide, allow the spirit of turpentine to flow out
on the opposite side of the cell till it is full of balsam; then
take up the cover, and carefully place upon it a small
streak of Canada balsam from one end to the other. This,
if laid on the cell with one edge first, and then gradually
lowered until it lies flat, will drive all the air before it, and
prevent any bubbles from being included in the cell. It can
be easily put on so neatly as to require no cleaning when
dry. If the cover is pressed down too rapidly, the balsam
will flow over it, and require to be cleaned off when
hardened, for it cannot be done safely while fluid at the
edges.”</p>

<p>Sometimes with every care bubbles are enclosed in the
balsam, injuring objects which are perhaps rare and valuable.
The whole slide must then be immersed in turpentine until
the cover is removed by the solution of the balsam; and the
object must be cleansed by a similar steeping. It may then
be remounted as if new in the manner before described.</p>

<p>The balsam and chloroform described in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a> is
thus used; and where the object is thin, the mounting is
very easily accomplished. When the object is laid upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
slide with a piece of glass upon it, and the balsam and
chloroform placed at the edge of the cover, the mixture will
gradually flow into the space betwixt the glasses until the
object is surrounded by it, and the unoccupied portion filled.
The chloroform will evaporate so quickly that the outer edge
will become hard in a very short time, when it may be
cleaned in the ordinary way. Sometimes the balsam is
dissolved in the chloroform without being first hardened;
but this is only to render it more fluid, and so give the
operator less chance of leaving bubbles in the finished slide,
as the thicker the medium is, the more difficult is it to get
rid of these intruders.</p>

<p>It has been before mentioned that some have objected to
chloroform and balsam, believing that it became <em>clouded</em>
after a certain time. Perhaps this may be accounted for
in part by the fact that almost all objects have a certain
amount of dampness in them. Others are kept in some
preservative liquid until the time of mounting, and these
liquids generally contain certain salts (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>). If
this dampness, as well as all traces of these salts, however
small, are not totally removed—the former by drying, the
latter by repeated washings—the addition of chloroform
will render the balsam much more liable to the cloudiness
than when balsam alone was used, as before mentioned.</p>

<p>This mode of employing the balsam, however, will not be
always applicable, as <em>chloroform</em> acts upon some substances
which balsam <em>alone</em> does not. Some salts are even soluble in
it, the crystals disappearing after a few days or weeks, whereas
in the balsam alone they are quite permanent. Experience
is the only guide in some cases, whilst in others a little
forethought will be all that is required.</p>

<p>The particular methods used for certain objects may be now
entered upon. Many of the Diatomaceæ and fossil Infusoria,
as they are sometimes termed, are mounted dry, and cleaned
in the way described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> Others are almost
always placed in balsam, except where they are intended to
be used with the lieberkuhn and dark background, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
means some of them are rendered exquisitely beautiful. The
usual way of mounting them in balsam is as follows:—Take
a drop of the water containing them, place it upon the slide,
and evaporate over the lamp, whilst with a needle they may
be dispersed over any space desired. When they are thoroughly
dry, drop a little balsam on one side, and exclude
the bubbles. The slide may then be warmed to such a
degree that the balsam, by lifting the glass at one end, will
be carried over the specimens, which may then be covered
with thin glass, made warm as before described. Where the
objects are quite dry, and loose upon the glass, it requires
great care in placing the cover upon them, otherwise they
are forced to one edge, or altogether from under it, in the
wave of the balsam. For this reason, Professor Williamson
adds a few drops of gum-water to the last washing, which
causes them to adhere sufficiently to the glass to prevent
any such mishap.</p>

<p>Mr. T. G. Rylands’ method differs in some degree from
the above, and is, to use his own words, as follows:—Thick
balsam is preferable, and the burnt covers (see <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>)
to be mounted are laid in a convenient position with the
diatoms upwards. The slides required having been carefully
cleaned and marked on the under side with a ring of
ink, by the aid of a turntable about half an inch in diameter
to point out the centre, a drop of benzole is applied by a
large pin to the diatoms on the cover, so as to exclude the
air from the valves and frustules. The slide is then held
over the lamp, and when warm, a sufficiently large drop of
balsam is put upon it, and heated until it begins to steam.
If small bubbles appear, a puff of breath removes them.
The slide being held slightly inclined from the operator, and
the drop of balsam becoming convex at its lower edge, the
cover is brought in contact with it at that point, gradually
laid down, pressed with the forceps, and brought to its
central position. When cool the superfluous balsam (if
any) is removed with a heated knife-blade, the slide cleaned
with a little turpentine, and finished by washing in a hand-basin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
with soap and water. In this process there is no
delay if the balsam be sufficiently thick, as the slide may be
cleaned off almost before it is cold.</p>

<p>It is now well known that from common chalk it is an
easy matter to obtain interesting specimens of Foraminifera.
Scrape a small quantity of chalk from the mass and shake
it in water; leave this a few minutes, pour the water away
and add a fresh quantity, shake up as before, and repeat
two or three times. Take a little of the residue, and spread
it upon the slide, and when quite dry add a little turpentine.
When viewed with a power of two hundred and fifty diameters
this will generally show the organisms very well.
If it is desired to preserve the slides, they may be then
mounted in Canada balsam. Mr. Guyon, in “Recreative
Science,” observes that the accumulation of the powder, by
the action of the rain or exposure to the atmospheric action,
at the foot or any projection of the chalk cliffs, will afford
us better specimens than that which is “scraped,” as the
organisms are less broken in the former.</p>

<p>When the Foraminifera are of a larger size, though transparent
enough to be mounted in balsam, the air must be
first expelled from the interior, otherwise the objects will be
altogether unsatisfactory. To accomplish this they must
be immersed in turpentine and submitted to the action of
the air-pump. So difficult is it to get rid of this enemy
that it is often necessary to employ three or four exhaustions,
leaving them for some time under each. When all
air has given place to the turpentine, they must be mounted
in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Of all objects which are commonly met with, few are such
general favourites as the <span class="smcap">Polycystinæ</span>, and deservedly so.
Their forms are most beautiful, and often peculiar—stars
varying in design, others closely resembling crowns; the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Astromma Aristotelis</i> like a cross, and many whose shapes
no words could describe. The greater part, perhaps, of
those which are usually sold, is from the rocky parts of
Bermuda; but they are also found in Sicily, some parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Africa and America. They are usually mounted in balsam,
but are equally beautiful mounted “dry” and used with the
lieberkuhn. They require as much care in cleaning as the
Diatomaceæ, but the process is a different one. Sometimes
this is effected by simply washing until they are freed from
all extraneous matter, but this is seldom as effectual as it
should be. In the <cite>Microscopic Journal</cite> Mr. Furlong gives
the following method of treatment as the best he <span class="locked">knew:—</span></p>

<p>Procure—</p>

<div class="in2">
<p class="hang">A large glass vessel with 3 or 4 quarts of water.</p>

<p class="hang">New tin saucepan holding 1 pint.</p>

<p class="hang">2 thin precipitating glasses holding 10 oz. each.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Take 3 oz. of dry “Barbadoes earth” (lumps are best), and
break into rather small fragments. Put 3 or 4 oz. of common
washing soda into the tin and half fill it with water.
Boil strongly, and having thrown in the earth, boil it for
half an hour. Pour nine-tenths of this into the large glass
vessel, and gently crush the remaining lumps with a soft
bristle brush. Add soda and water as before, and boil
again; then pour off the liquid into the large vessel, and
repeat until nothing of value remains. Stir the large vessel
with an ivory spatula, let it stand for three minutes, and pour
gently off nine-tenths of the contents, when the shells will
be left, partially freed only, like sand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">2nd Process.</span>—Put common washing soda and water into
the tin as before, and having placed the shells therein, boil
for an hour. Transfer to the large vessel as before, and
after allowing it to stand for one minute pour off. Each
washing brings off a kind of “flock,” which seems to be
skins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">3rd Process.</span>—Put the shells in precipitating glass and
drain off the water until not more than ½ oz. remains. Add
half a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, dissolve, and then
pour in gently 1 oz. of strong sulphuric acid. This liberates
the “flock,” &amp;c., and leaves the shells beautifully transparent.
Wash well now with water to get rid of all salts and other
soluble matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Some of the large shells are destroyed by this method,
but none that are fit for microscopic use. An oblique light
shows these objects best.</p>

<p>These are sometimes treated in the manner described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> where the diatoms are spoken of, but many
forms are liable to be injured by this severe process.</p>

<p>It has been before stated that some of the zoophytes may
be mounted dry, and others examined as opaque or transparent
objects according to their substance. They are very
interesting when examined in the trough whilst living, but
to preserve many of them for future examination they must
be mounted in some preservative medium. Sometimes this
may be one of the liquids mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>, but
if possible they should be kept in balsam, as there is less
danger of injury by accident to this kind of slide. This
method of mounting presents some difficulties, but I think
that all agree as to the trustworthiness of Dr. Golding Bird’s
information on the subject, which appeared in the <cite>Microscopic
Journal</cite>. Of this, space forbids me to give more than
a condensed account, but I hope to omit nothing of moment
to the reader for whom these pages are written.</p>

<p>After stating that there are few who are not familiar
with these exquisite forms, and have not regretted the great
loss of beauty they sustain in dying, he informs us that
from their so obstinately retaining air in the cells and tubes
when dried, it is hardly practicable to get rid of it; and
they also shrivel up very seriously in the process of drying.
The following plan, however, he has found almost faultless
in their preparation.</p>

<p>To preserve them with extended tentacles, they should be
plunged in cold fresh water, which kills them so quickly
that these are not often retracted. The specimens should
be preserved in spirit until there is leisure to prepare them;
if, however, they have been <em>dried</em>, they should be soaked in
cold water for a day or two before being submitted to the
following <span class="locked">processes:—</span></p>

<p>1. After selecting perfect specimens of suitable size, immerse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
them in water heated to about 120° and place them
under the receiver of an air-pump. Slowly exhaust the
air, when bubbles will rise and the water appear to be in a
state of active ebullition. After a few minutes re-admit
the air and again exhaust, repeating the process three or
four times. This will displace the air from most, if not all,
of the class.</p>

<p>2. Remove the specimens and allow them to drain upon
blotting-paper for a few seconds; then place them in an
earthen vessel fitted with a cover, and previously heated
to about 200°. This heat may be easily got by placing
the vessel for a short time in boiling water, wiping it
immediately before use with a thick cloth. The specimens
are then dropped into this, covered with the lid,
and immediately placed under the receiver of the air-pump,
and the air rapidly exhausted. By this means they
are dried completely, and so quickly that the cells have
no time to wrinkle.</p>

<p>3. In an hour or two remove them from the air-pump
and drop them into a vessel of perfectly transparent camphine.
This may be quite cold when the horny, tubular
polypidoms, as those of the Sertulariæ, are used; but should
be previously heated to 100° when the calcareous, cellular
Polyzoa are the objects to be preserved. The vessel should
be covered with a watch-glass and placed under the receiver,
the air being exhausted and re-admitted two or three times.</p>

<p>4. The slide which is to receive the specimen should be
well cleaned and warmed so as to allow the balsam to flow
freely over it. This must be applied in good quantity,
and air-bubbles removed with the needle-point. Take the
polypidom from the camphine, drain it a little, and with
the forceps immerse it fully in the balsam. The glass to
be laid upon it should be warmed and its surface covered
with a thin layer of balsam, and then lowered gradually
upon it, when no bubbles should be imprisoned. A narrow
piece of card-board at each end of the object for the cover
to rest upon, prevents any danger of crushing the specimen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
This mode of mounting polypidoms, &amp;c., seems to give
almost the complete beauty of the fresh specimens. They
are very beautiful objects when viewed with common light,
but much more so when the polarizer is used (in the
manner described a little farther on).</p>

<p>To the above instructions there can be little to add; but
I may here mention that some young students may not be
possessed of the air-pump, and on this account put aside
all search for those specimens which need little looking for
at the seaside. Many of these, however, though they lose
some beauty by the ordinary mode of drying, will by
steeping for some time in turpentine not only be freed
from the air-bubbles, but suffer so little contraction that
they are a worthy addition to the cabinet.</p>

<p>Another class of objects is the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spicula</i> met with in
sponges, &amp;c. These are often glass-like in appearance and
of various shapes; many are found resembling needles
(whence their name); some from the synapta are anchor-like,
whilst others are star-like and of complex and almost
indescribable combinations. As some of these are composed
of silex and are consequently not injured by the use
of nitric acid, the animal substance may be got rid of by
boiling them in it. Those, however, which are calcareous
must be treated with a strong solution of potash instead;
but whichever way is used, of course they must afterwards
be freed from every trace of residue by careful
washing.</p>

<p>These spicules may be often found amongst the sand
which generally accumulates at the bottom of the jars in
which sponges are kept by those who deal in them, and
must be picked out with a camel-hair pencil. The specimens
obtained by this means will seldom if ever require
any cleaning process, as they are quite free from animal
matter, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the former chapter was noticed those insects or parts
of them which are usually mounted dry. When they are
large and too opaque to admit of the dry treatment, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
must be preserved in Canada balsam or fluid. The first of
these may now be considered.</p>

<p>It may be here mentioned, that with these objects much
heat must not be employed, as it would in some instances
give rise to a cloudiness, and almost invariably injure
them.</p>

<p>In killing the insect it is necessary not to rub or break
any part of it. This may be performed by placing it
in a small box half filled with fragments of fresh laurel
leaves, by immersion in turpentine or strong spirit, as
also in solutions of various poisonous salts. After which
it may be preserved for sometime in turpentine or other
preservative liquid (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>) until required. As an
assistance to the student, I believe that I can do no better
than give him the plan pursued by my friend Mr. Hepworth,
whose specimens are in every way satisfactory;
but when his method is used, the insects must not have been
placed in turpentine for <span class="locked">preservation:—</span></p>

<p>“After destroying the insects in chloroform or sulphuric
ether (methylated being cheaper), wash them thoroughly in
a wide-necked bottle, half-filled, with two or three waters;
the delicate ones requiring great care. Then immerse
them in liquid potash (or Brandish’s solution, which is
stronger than the usual preparation), and let them remain a
longer or shorter time according to their texture. When
ready to remove, put one by one into a small saucer of clear
water, and with a camel-hair pencil in each hand press
them flat to the bottom, holding the head and thorax with
the left-hand brush, and apply pressure with the other from
above, downwards, giving the brush a rolling motion, which
generally expels the contents of the abdomen from the
thorax. A minute roller of pith or cork might be used
instead of the brush. In larger objects, use the end of the
finger to flatten them. Large objects require more frequent
washing, as it is desirable to remove the potash thoroughly,
or crystals are apt to form after mounting. Having placed
them on the slides with thin glass covers, tied down with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
thread,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> dry and immerse them in rectified spirits of turpentine;
place the vessel under the receiver of an air-pump,
and keep it exhausted until the turpentine has taken
the place of the air-bubbles: they are then ready for the
application of the balsam. Larger objects may often with
advantage be transferred to a clean slide, as during the
drying there is considerable contraction, and an outline
often remains beyond the margin showing this. When
closely corked they may remain in the spirits two or three
months. As you take them from the bottle, wipe as much
turpentine off as possible before removing the thread, and
when untied carefully wipe again, placing the finger on one
end of the cover whilst you wipe the other, and vice versâ.
By this means you remove as much turpentine from under the
cover as is necessary; then drop the balsam, thinned with
chloroform (see <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>), upon the slide, letting the fluid
touch the cover, when it will be taken in between the
surfaces by capillary attraction; and after pressing the
cover down it may be left to dry, or you may hold the
slide over a spirit-lamp for a few seconds before pressing
down the cover. If heat is not applied, they are much longer
in drying but are more transparent. If made too hot the
boiling disarranges the objects, and if carried too far will
leave only the resin of the balsam, rendering it so brittle
that the cover is apt to fly off by a fall or any jar producing
sufficient percussion. Never lift the cover up, if possible,
during the operation, as there is danger of admitting air.
A few bubbles may appear immediately after mounting, but
generally subside after a few hours, being only the chloroform
or turpentine in a state of vapour, which becomes
condensed.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> This applies to the more delicate ones, which will not bear
transferring after being once spread out and dried.</p></div>

<p>This method of preparing and mounting insects I can
strongly recommend as giving first-rate results; but where the
specimens are small they seldom need the soaking in caustic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
potash which larger ones must have. It is only necessary
to leave them awhile in turpentine, especially when they have
been first dried with gentle pressure between two glasses,
and then mount with balsam in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Amongst the insect tribes there is abundant employment,
especially for the lower powers of the microscope. But if
the deeper wonders and beauties of the animal economy are
to be sought out and studied, it is desirable that the various
parts should be set separately, in order that they may
receive a more undivided attention, as well as to render
them capable of being dealt with under the higher powers.
We will, therefore, briefly consider the treatment which the
different portions require.</p>

<p>The eyes of the butterflies, and indeed of almost all insects,
afford materials for a study which is complete in itself.
When examined with a tolerably high power, instead of
finding each eye with an unbroken spherical surface, it is seen
that many are composed of thousands of hexagonal divisions,
each being the outer surface of a separate portion termed
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ocellus</i>. In others these divisions are square; but in all
there is a layer of dark pigment surrounding their lower
parts. The ocelli may be partly removed from the eye,
which will show how their tapering forms are arranged.
But here we have to consider how to place them in balsam
for preservation. The eye being removed from the insect,
and the dark pigment removed by the use of a camel-hair
pencil, must be allowed to remain in turpentine at least
for some days. The turpentine should then be renewed and
the eye well washed in it just before it is to be mounted.
It may then be set in balsam in the same way as any other
object;—but here a difficulty is met with. The eye being
spherical upon the surface required, must necessarily be
“folded” or broken in attempting to flatten it. This difficulty
may be often overcome by cutting a number of slits
round the edges; but some object to this mode of treatment,
and where it is practicable it is much more satisfactory to
mount one in the natural rounded form and another flat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Instead, however, of mounting the organ <em>whole</em>, four or five
slides may be procured from each of the larger ones, as
those of the dragon-fly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <em>antennæ</em> also are often mounted on separate slides,
as being better suited for higher powers and more minute
examination than when connected with the insect. These
two projecting organs, issuing from the head, are jointed, and
moveable at will. They differ very much in form amongst
the various species, and are well worth the attention of the
microscopist. They are usually mounted with the head
attached, and perhaps they are more interesting when thus
seen. Some few are very opaque, to prepare which the
following method has been <span class="locked">advised:—</span></p>

<p>Bleach the antennæ by soaking in the following solution
for a day or <span class="locked">two:—</span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0">
Hydrochloric acid, 10 drops.<br />
Chlorate of potash, ½ drachm.<br />
Water, 1 oz.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">This will render them transparent. Wash well, dry, and
mount in Canada balsam. Instead of the above, a weak
solution of chloride of lime may be used, by which means
the nerves will be well shown. Many, however, are rendered
transparent enough by simply soaking in turpentine for a
longer or shorter time. Where the antennæ, however, are
“plumose,” or feather-like, extreme care is required in
mounting, though the difficulty is not so great as some seem
to think. If they are first dried with gentle pressure, and
then subjected to the action of the air-pump in a small
quantity of turpentine until the air is thoroughly expelled,
they can be easily finished upon the slide, especially when
balsam and chloroform are used.</p>

<p>Insects supply us with another series of beautiful objects,
viz., the <em>feet</em>.<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> These are sometimes simply dried and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
mounted without any medium, as before mentioned; but
most of them are rendered much more fit for examination
by using balsam in their preservation, as it greatly increases
their transparency. The smaller kinds may be dried with
gentle pressure betwixt blotting-paper, and then immersed
for some days in turpentine, without requiring the treatment
with liquor potassæ. This immersion will render them
beautifully transparent, when they may be mounted in
balsam in the usual manner.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> See Mr. Hepworth’s interesting articles on the fly’s foot in the
second and third volumes of the <cite>Microscopic Journal</cite>.</p></div>

<p>It is, however, sometimes found difficult to fix the feet
when <em>expanded</em>, in which state the interest of the object is
greatly increased. Mr. Ralph recommends the following
mode:—“First wash the feet, while the insect is yet alive,
with spirits of wine; then holding it by a pair of forceps
close to the edge of a clean piece of glass, the insect will lay
hold of the upper surface by its foot, then suddenly drop
another small piece of glass over it, so as to retain the foot
expanded, and cut it off with a pair of scissors, tie up
and soak to get rid of air.” Mr. Hepworth says that he
never found any difficulty in expanding the foot on a
drop of water or well-wetted slide, and laying a thin glass
cover over it, tying with thread, drying, and immersing in
turpentine.</p>

<p>The mouth, also, with its organs, is an interesting object
in many insects. That of the common fly is often made
use of, and is comparatively easy to prepare. By pressing
the head, the tongue (as it is commonly termed) will be forced
to protrude, when it must be secured by the same means as
the foot, and may be subjected to the soaking in turpentine,
and mounted as usual. The honey-bee is, however, very
different in formation, and is well worth another slide;
indeed, even in insects of the same class, the differences are
many and interesting.</p>

<p>Another worthy object of study is the <em>respiration</em> of
insects, which is effected by tracheæ or hollow tubes, which
generally run through the body in one or more large trunks,
branching out on every side. These terminate at the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in openings, which are termed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spiracles</i>, or breathing
organs. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tracheæ</i> often present the appearance of tubes
constructed by a twisted thread, somewhat resembling the
spiral fibres of some plants. These are very beautiful
objects, and are generally mounted in balsam, for which
reason they are mentioned here; but as they evidently belong
to the “dissecting portion,” they will be fully treated of in
another place.</p>

<p>Amongst the parasitic insects a great variety of microscopic
subjects will be found. As these are usually small,
they may be killed by immersion in spirits of turpentine; and
if at all opaque, may be allowed to remain in the liquid until
transparent enough, and then mounted in Canada balsam.</p>

<p>The acarida, or <em>mites</em> and <em>ticks</em>, are well known; none,
perhaps, better than those which are so often found upon
cheese. Flour, sugar, figs, and other eatables, are much
infested by them; whilst the diseases called the <em>itch</em> in man,
and the <em>mange</em> in animals, are produced by creatures
belonging to this tribe. These animals are sometimes
mounted by simply steeping them in turpentine, and proceeding
as with other insects. The “Micrographic Dictionary”
gives the following directions as to mounting <em>parts</em> of
these:—“The parts of the mouth and the legs, upon which
the characters are usually founded, may be best made out by
crushing the animals upon a slide with a thin glass cover,
and washing away the exuding substance with water; sometimes
hot solution of potash is requisite, with the subsequent
addition of acetic acid, and further washing. When afterwards
dried and immersed in Canada balsam, the various
parts become beautifully distinct, and may be permanently
preserved.”</p>

<p>Feathers of different kinds of birds are usually mounted
in balsam when required to show much of the structure.
This is particularly interesting when the feathers are small,
as they then show the inner substance, or <em>pith</em>, as it may be
termed, with the cells, &amp;c. The “pinnæ,” or soft branches
of the feathers, will be found of various constructions; some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
possessing hooks along one side, whereby they fasten
themselves to their neighbours; others branching out, with
straight points somewhat resembling the hairs from certain
caterpillars. But, of course, when the metallic-looking
gorgeous colours are all that is required to be shown, and
reflected light used (as with the feathers of the hummingbird,
peacock, &amp;c.), it is much better that they should be
mounted dry, as in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>The <em>seeds</em> and <em>pollen</em> of plants are most frequently
mounted dry, as mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>; but the more
transparent of the former, and the darker kinds of the
latter, are perhaps better seen in Canada balsam. There
is nothing particular to be observed in the manipulation,
except that the glass cover must be applied lightly, otherwise
the grains may be crushed. There are some objects which
cannot be shown in a perfect manner when mounted <em>dry</em>, but
when immersed in balsam become so very transparent that
they are almost useless. To avoid this, it has been recommended
to stain the objects any colour that may be convenient,
and afterwards mount in balsam in the ordinary
manner.</p>

<p>Most objects intended for the polariscope may be mounted
in Canada balsam; but there are some exceptions to this.
Many of the salts are soluble in this medium, or their
forms so injured by it, that glycerine or oil has to be used
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>); others must be left in the dry form,
as before mentioned; and some few it is impossible to
preserve unchanged for any length of time. <em>Crystals</em>,
however, are amongst the most beautiful and interesting
subjects for polarisation; and it is very probable that, by
the aid of the polariscope, new and valuable facts are yet to
be made known. For one who finds pleasure in form and
colour, there is a field here which will only open wider upon
him as he advances; and instead of being in anywise a
merely mechanical occupation, it requires deep and careful
study. The little here said on the subject will show this in
some degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
With almost every salt the method of <em>crystallization</em> must
be modified to obtain the best forms; I may even go
further than this, and say that it is possible to change these
forms to such a degree that the eye can perceive no relationship
to exist betwixt them. If a solution of sulphate of
iron is made, a small quantity spread evenly upon a slide,
and then suffered to dry whilst in a flat position, the crystals
often resemble the fronds of the common fern in shape. But
if, whilst the liquid is evaporating, it is kept in motion by
stirring with a thin glass rod, the crystals form separately,
each rhombic prism having its angles well defined, and
giving beautiful colours with the polarized light. Again,
pyro-gallic acid, when allowed to flow evenly over the
slide in a saturated solution, covers the surface in long
“needles,” which are richly coloured by polarized light; but
if any small portion of dust or other matter should form a
nucleus around which these “needles” may gather, the
beauty is wonderfully increased. A form very closely resembling
the “eye” of the peacock’s tail, both in form and
colour, is then produced, which to one uninitiated in crystallography
bears very little resemblance to the original crystal.
From these simple facts it will be clearly seen that in this,
as in every other department, study and experience are
needful to give the best results.</p>

<p>To obtain anything like uniformity in the formation of
crystals upon the glass slide, every trace of grease must
be removed by cleaning with liquor potassæ or ammonia
immediately before using, care also being taken that none
of the agent is left upon the slide, otherwise it may
interrupt and change their relative position, and even
their form.</p>

<p>Amongst those which are generally esteemed, the most
beautiful are the crystals of oxalurate of ammonia. The
preparation of this salt from uric acid and ammonia is a
rather difficult process, and will not on that account be
described here; but when possessed, a small quantity of a
strong solution in water must be made, and a little placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
on the slide, and evaporated slowly. Part of the salt will
then be deposited in circles with the needle-like crystals
extending from common centres. They should then be
mounted in pure Canada balsam; and, when the best colours
are wanted, used with the selenite plate. Of this class of
crystal salicine is a universal favourite, and can be easily
procured of most chemists. The crystals may be produced
in two ways:—A small portion of the salt must be placed
upon the slide, and a strong heat applied underneath until
fusion ensues; the matter should then be evenly and thinly
spread over the surface. In a short time the crystals will
form, and are generally larger than those procured by the
following process; but the uncertainty is increased a little
when fusion is used, which, however, is desirable with many
salts. Secondly, make a saturated solution of salicine,
which in cold water is effected by adding one part of the
salt to eighteen parts of water. Lay a little upon the
slide, and allow it to evaporate spontaneously, or with
the aid of gentle heat. The crystals are generally uniform,
and with ordinary powers quite large enough to afford a
beautiful object. The circular shape and gorgeous colours
of this crystal have made it so great a favourite that there
are few cabinets without it.</p>

<p>Many new forms may be procured by uniting two totally
different salts in solution in certain proportions. This is a
field affording new facts and beauties; but requires some
chemical knowledge and much perseverance to obtain very
valuable results. One of the most beautiful I have met with
has been composed of sulphate of copper and sulphate of magnesia.
The flower-like forms and uniformity of crystallization
when successful make it well worth a few failures at first;
and as I became acquainted with some new facts in my frequent
trials, I will give the preparation of the double salt
from the beginning.</p>

<p>Make a saturated solution of the two sulphates, combined
in the proportion of three parts copper to one part magnesia,
and then add to the solution one-tenth of pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
water. Dust or other impurities should be guarded against,
and the slide made free from all trace of grease by cleaning
immediately before use with liquor potassæ or ammonia. A
drop of the solution should then be placed upon the slide,
and by a thin glass rod spread evenly upon the surface.
Heat this whilst in a horizontal position until the salt
remains as a viscous transparent substance, which will not
be effected until it is raised to a high degree. The slide may
now be allowed to cool, and when this is accomplished, the
flower-like crystals will be perceived forming here and there
upon the plate. When these are at any stage in which it is
wished to preserve them, a few seconds’ exposure to the fire,
as warm as the hand can comfortably bear, will stop the
expansion, when the portion which we wish to mount should
be cut off from the mass of salt by simply scratching the
film around, and pure Canada balsam with the thin glass
used. Breathing upon the film, or allowing the slide to become
cold and attract the moisture from the atmosphere, will
cause the crystallization to extend, and sometimes greatly
rob the effect; so it is necessary to mount quickly when the
desired forms are obtained. As the crystals are very uncertain
as to the place of their formation, I may here
mention that they may be got in <em>any</em> part of the slide by
piercing the film with a needle-point; but in some degree
this necessarily interferes with the centre. As the cause of
this has no need to be entered into here, and has been elsewhere
discussed, I shall only give the above directions, and
say that there is a great field in this branch of study which
the microscope alone has opened.</p>

<p>It would be useless to enter into particulars respecting the
various salts and treatment they require, as a great difference
is effected even by the strength of the solution. There
are some crystals, also, which are called forth in insulated
portions, showing no formation upon the ground; but even
when mounted in any preserving fluid, and unchanged for a
year, a new action seems to arise, and a groundwork is produced
which bears little resemblance to the original crystal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Sometimes this new formation adds to the beauty of the
slide; in other cases the reverse is the result, the slide being
rendered almost worthless. This action, I believe, frequently
arises from some liquid being contained in the balsam or
other mounting medium used; and this is rendered the more
probable by the crystallization being called forth in an hour
after the balsam diluted with chloroform is employed,
whereas no change would have taken place for months (if at
all) had pure balsam been used.</p>

<p>Sections of some of the salts are very interesting
objects, but the method of procuring these and their nature
will be described in <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a></p>

<p>The scales of various fish have been before mentioned as
mounted “dry;” when, however, they are required for
polarising objects they are generally mounted in balsam,
and some few in liquid. The former method will be considered
here.</p>

<p>The eel affords a beautiful object for this purpose. The
scales are covered by a thin “<em>skin</em>,” which may be slightly
raised with a knife and then torn off, in the same manner
as the covering of the geranium and other petals, described
in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> The required portion may then be removed;
or if a piece of skin can be procured as stripped off in
cooking, the scales may be easily taken from the inner
surface. They must then be washed and thoroughly
cleaned. After drying, soak for a day in turpentine, and
mount in the ordinary manner with balsam. This is a
good polarising object; but the interest, and I think the
beauty, is increased by procuring a piece of eel’s skin with
the scales <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in sitû</i>, washing and drying under pressure, and
mounting in balsam as before. The arrangement of the
scales produces beautiful “waves” of colour, which are
quite soothing to the eye after examining some of the very
gorgeous salts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are many scales of fish which are good subjects for
the polariscope when mounted in balsam; but as they require
no particular treatment, they need no mention by name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Among hairs we find some which are beautiful when
mounted in balsam and examined by polarized light. Some,
when wanted as common objects, are always used dry, as
before mentioned; but if they are intended to be shown as
<em>polarizing</em> objects, they must be placed in some medium.
The “Micrographic Dictionary” mentions a mode of making
an interesting object by plaiting two series of white horse-hairs
at an angle, mounting in balsam, and using with the
polariscope. All hairs, however, must be steeped in turpentine
for a short time before mounting, as they will thus
be rendered cleaner and more transparent. When this is
done, there is no difficulty in mounting them.</p>

<p>Many of the “tongues” of fresh-water and marine
mollusca are deeply interesting and most beautiful objects
when examined by polarized light. As these are usually
mounted in balsam, I mention them in this place; but as
they must be removed from the animals by dissection,
particulars respecting them will not be entered into until
we come to the part in which that operation is described
(<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V.</a>).</p>

<p>The manner of preparing and mounting many of the
Polyzoa and Zoophytes has been before described; but any
notice of <em>polarizing</em> objects would be incomplete without
some allusion to them. A small piece of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Flustra
avicularis</i>, well prepared, is beautiful when examined in
this manner. No selenite is needed, and yet the colours
are truly gorgeous. It is often met with upon shells and
zoophytes of a large size, and will well repay the trouble
of searching for. Many of the Sertularidæ are very beautiful
with polarized light, and, indeed, no ramble upon the
seaside need be fruitless in this direction.</p>

<p>The different <em>starches</em> are quite a study in themselves,
and are peculiarly connected with polarized light. They
are found in the cellular tissue of almost every plant in
small white grains which vary considerably in size; that
from the potato averages one-three-hundredth of an inch in
diameter, and that from arrow-root about one-six-hundredth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
To procure starch from any plant, the texture must first be
broken up or ground coarsely; the mass of matter must be
then well washed in gently-flowing water, and, as all starch
is totally insoluble in cold water, the grains are carried off
by the current and deposited where this is stayed. In procuring
it from the potato, as well as many other vegetables,
it is but necessary to reduce the substance to a coarse pulp
by the aid of a culinary “grater;” the pulp should then
be well agitated in water, and allowed to rest a short time,
when the starch will be found at the bottom, its lighter
colour rendering it easily distinguishable from the pulp. It
should, however, be washed through two or three waters to
render it perfectly clean.</p>

<p>These grains have no crystalline structure, but present a
very peculiar appearance when examined with polarized
light. Each grain shows a dark cross whose lines meet at
the point where it was attached to the plant, called the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">hilum</i>. Round the grain, also, a series of lines are seen, as
though it were put together in plates. This is more distinctly
visible in some kinds than others.</p>

<p>As to the mounting of these starches there is little to be
said. If the grains are laid upon the slide, and as small a
portion as possible of the balsam diluted with turpentine,
as before mentioned, be applied, they will cling to the glass
and allow the pure balsam to flow readily over them without
being so liable to imprison air-bubbles when the thin
glass is put upon them.</p>

<p>The raphides, which were fully described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>,
when required for use with polarized light, must be mounted
in balsam, and many are found which give beautiful colours.
They require no peculiar treatment, but must be washed
quite clean before putting up.</p>

<p>There is one class of objects for the polariscope which
differs in preparation from any we have yet considered, and
affords very beautiful specimens. Some of the plants, including
many of the grasses and the Equisetaceæ (<i>i. e.</i> horsetails),
contain so large a quantity of silica, that when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
vegetable and other perishable parts are removed, a skeleton
of wonderful perfection remains. This skeleton must be
mounted in balsam, the method of performing which will
now be considered.</p>

<p>Sometimes the cuticle of the equisetum is removed from
the plant, others dry the stem under pressure, whilst the
grasses, of course, require no preparation. The vegetable
should be immersed in strong nitric acid and boiled for a
short time; an effervescence will go on as the alkalies are
being removed, and when this has ceased more acid should
be added. At this point the modes of treatment differ;
some remove the object from the acid and wash, and having
dried, burn it upon thin glass until all appears <em>white</em>, when
it must be carefully mounted in balsam. I think, however,
it is better to leave it in strong acid until all the substance,
except the required portion, is removed; but this will take
a length of time, varying according to the mass, &amp;c., of the
plant. Of course, when this latter method is used, the
skeleton must be washed from the acid, &amp;c., before being
mounted in balsam.</p>

<p>These <em>siliceous cuticles</em> are readily found. The <em>straws</em> of
most of the cereals, wheat, oat, &amp;c.; the <em>husks</em>, also, of some
of these; many <em>canes</em>; the equisetum, as before described;
and some of the grasses. Many of these are everywhere
procurable, so that the student can never want material for
a splendid object for the polariscope.</p>

<p>In <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a> the <em>scales</em> (or hairs) which are often found
upon the leaves of plants were mentioned as beautiful objects
when mounted dry; but some of these when detached from
the leaf—which is easily done by gently scraping it, when
dried, with a knife—present brilliant starlike and other
forms, if mounted in balsam and used with the polariscope.
There is a little danger, when placing the thin glass upon
the balsam, of forcing out the scales in the wave of matter
which is always ejected; this may be overcome by applying
to the slide, previously to placing the objects upon it, an
extremely thin covering of the balsam diluted with turpentine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
as before mentioned, and thus giving them every chance
of adherence; or by using the balsam with chloroform, as
before noticed. These scales are much more abundant than
was formerly supposed, and daily new specimens are discovered;
so that the student should always be on the lookout
for them in his researches in the vegetable world.</p>

<p>Most classes of objects, and the treatment they require
when mounting them in balsam, have now been considered.
The next chapter will be devoted to the preservative liquids,
and the best methods of using them.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV" class="vspace"><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER IV</span>.<br />

<span class="subhead">PRESERVATIVE LIQUIDS, ETC., PARTICULARLY WHERE CELLS ARE
USED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> are many objects which would lose all their distinctive
peculiarities if allowed to become dry, especially those
belonging to the fresh-water Algæ, many animal tissues,
and most of the very delicate animal and vegetable substances
in which structure is to be shown. These must be
preserved by immersion in some fluid; but it is evident that
the fluid must be suited to the kind of matter which it is
intended to preserve. As it often requires much study
and trouble to <em>obtain</em> microscopic objects of this class, it
is well that their <em>preservation</em> should be rendered as perfect
as possible; and for this reason the <span class="smcap smaller">CELLS</span>, or receptacles
of the fluids, should be so closed that all possibility of
escape should be prevented. The accomplishment of this
is not so easy a matter as it might appear to the inexperienced.</p>

<p>Before giving any directions as to the manipulation
required in mounting the objects, we must consider the
different <em>liquids</em> and <em>cells</em> which are requisite for their
preservation. Of the former there are a great number, of
which the principal may be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distilled Water</span> is strongly recommended by many for
Diatomaceæ and other Protophytes. It has been, however,
stated that confervoid growths often disturb the clearness
of the liquid, and on this account various additions are
made to it. A lump of camphor is often left in the bottle,
so that the water may dissolve as much as possible. One
grain of bay-salt and one of alum are added to each ounce
of water; or a drop or two of creosote shaken up with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
ounce of water, which should be afterwards filtered. These
additions are often made; perhaps each of them good for
certain objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glycerine.</span>—Some affirm this to be one of the best
preservative liquids, especially for vegetable objects; but
others think that it is much better when diluted with two
parts of camphor-water, prepared as above.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Dr. Carpenter says:—“Glycerine has a solvent power for carbonate
of lime, and should not be employed when the object contains
any calcareous structure. In ignorance of this fact, the author (Dr.
C.) employed glycerine to preserve a number of remarkably fine specimens
of the pentacrinoid larva of the Comatula, whose colours he was
anxious to retain; and was extremely vexed to find, when about to
mount them, that their calcareous skeletons had so entirely disappeared,
that the specimens were completely ruined.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Glycerine and Gum.</span>—This is also believed to be a very
good liquid for vegetable tissues, and is thus <span class="locked">prepared:—</span></p>

<table class="narrow15" summary="glycerine and gum">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Pure gum-arabic</td>
    <td class="tdl">1 oz.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Glycerine</td>
    <td class="tdl">1  ”</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Water (distilled)</td>
    <td class="tdl">1  ”</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Arsenious acid</td>
    <td class="tdl">1½ grains.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">Dissolve the arsenious acid in the cold water, then the gum,
add the glycerine, and mix without bubbles.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Deane’s Compound.</span>—This is usually deemed about the
best medium for preserving Algæ, mosses, &amp;c., and is thus
prepared:—Soak 1 oz. of best gelatine in 4 oz. of water
until the gelatine becomes soft, when 5 oz. of honey heated
to boiling-point are added; boil the mixture, and when
it has cooled, but not enough to become stiff, add ½ oz.
rectified spirit with which 5 or 6 drops of creosote have been
well mixed, and filter the whole through fine flannel. This
compound when cold forms a stiff jelly, the use of which
will be described elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glycerine Jelly.</span>—This mixture closely resembles the
above, but as the composition differs a little it may be
mentioned here. It is strongly recommended by Mr.
Lawrance in the <cite>Microscopic Journal</cite>, where he states “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the beautiful green of some mosses mounted two years
ago, is still as fresh as the day they were gathered;” and
that this is the only medium he knows which will preserve
the natural colour of vegetable substances. He takes a
quantity of Nelson’s gelatine, soaks it for two or three
hours in cold water, pours off the superfluous water, and
heats the soaked gelatine until melted. To each fluid
ounce of the gelatine, <em>whilst it is fluid but cool</em>, he adds a
fluid drachm of the white of an egg. He then boils this
until the albumen coagulates and the gelatine is quite
clear, when it is to be filtered through fine flannel, and
to each ounce of the clarified solution add 6 drachms of a
mixture composed one part of glycerine to two parts of
camphor-water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goadby’s Fluid.</span>—This is much used in the preservation
of animal objects; and seldom, if ever, acts upon the colours.
It is thus prepared—Bay salt, 4 oz.; alum, 2 oz.; corrosive-sublimate,
4 grains. Dissolve these in two quarts of boiling
water and filter. For delicate preparations some recommend
that this mixture be reduced by the addition of an
equal quantity of water; but where there is bone or shell in
the object the above acts injuriously upon it, in which case
this fluid may be used:—Bay-salt 8 oz., corrosive sublimate
2 grains, water 1 quart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thwaites’ Liquid.</span>—This is recommended for the preservation
of Algæ, &amp;c., as having little or no action on the
colour, and is thus prepared:—Take one part of rectified
spirit, add drops of creosote enough to saturate it; to this add
sixteen parts of distilled water and a little prepared chalk,
and filter. When filtered, mix with an equal quantity of
camphor-water (as before mentioned), and strain through
fine muslin before using.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of Zinc Solution.</span>—In the “Micrographic Dictionary”
this is stated to be “perhaps the best preservative
known for animal tissues.” Persons of great experience,
however, have given a very different opinion; but it is certainly
very useful in many cases where a small degree of coagulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
action is not injurious. It is used of strengths varying
according to the softness of the parts to be preserved; the
average being 20 grains of the fused chloride to 1 oz. of
distilled water. To keep this liquid a lump of camphor
may be left floating in the bottle. I have heard complaints
that this mixture becomes turbid with keeping, but I think
this must only be the case when some impurity has got into
the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbolic Acid.</span>—This substance has not been known
long enough to warrant any decided opinion upon its merits.
A solution of 1 part of acid to 20 of water has been
recommended on account of its antiseptic properties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castor Oil.</span>—This is a very useful preservative for
crystals and other objects. Many salts are quite destroyed
when Canada balsam is used with them; but very few are
acted upon by this oil. To use it, it must be dropped in
a sufficient quantity to cover the crystal or object to be
preserved with a thin coating of oil. It may be necessary
sometimes to spread it with a needle or other instrument. The
thin glass should then be carefully placed upon it, so that all
air may be excluded; and should any oil be forced out, owing
to the quantity used being too great, it must be removed
with blotting paper. When the edge of the thin glass cover
and the surrounding parts of the slide are as clean as
possible, a coating of sealing-wax varnish or liquid glue must
be applied and allowed to dry. A second or even a third coating
may be required, but not before the previous cover is quite
dry. These varnishes, however, are very brittle, and it is much
safer, as a finish, to use one of the tougher cements—gold-size,
for instance—which will render it doubly secure.</p>

<p>The above are the principal liquids, &amp;c., used for preserving
objects in cells. The different cells may be here
mentioned; and it is recommended that these should always
be kept some time before use in order that the cement may
become perfectly dry; and care must be taken that no
cement be used on which the preservative liquid employed
has any action whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
<span class="smcap">Cement Cells.</span>—Where the object is not very thick, this
kind of cell is generally used. They are easily made with the
turntable before described; but when the objects to be
preserved are <em>very</em> minute, these cells need not be much
deeper than the <em>ordinary</em> circle of cement on the slide.
When, however, a comparatively great depth is required, it
is sometimes necessary to make the wall of the cell as deep
as possible, then allow it to dry and make another addition.
Of these cements gold-size is one of the most trustworthy,
and may be readily used for the shallow cells. The asphaltum
and india-rubber, before noticed, I have found very
durable when well baked, and exceedingly pleasant to work
with. It may be used of such a thickness as to give space
for tolerably large objects. Black japan also is much used.
Many cements, however, which are recommended by some
writers, are worse than useless, owing to the brittleness which
renders their durability uncertain, as sealing-wax varnish,
liquid-glue, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The student may feel himself at a loss in choosing the
cement which will give him the <em>safest</em> cells, many of them
becoming partially or wholly dry in a year or two, as stated
in another place. I can only give him a few general directions,
and he must then use his own judgment. Of course
it would be lost labour to employ any cement upon which
the preservative liquid has <em>any action whatever</em>. It is also
a good rule to avoid those in whose composition there are
any particles which do not become a thorough and intimate
portion, as these unreduced fragments will almost certainly,
sooner or later, prepare a road by which the liquid will
escape; and, lastly, whatever cement he uses, the cells are
always better when they have been kept a short time
before use, as already stated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gutta-percha Rings</span> have been recommended by some, as
affording every facility for the manufacture of cells for
liquids; but they cannot be recommended, as, after a certain
length of time, they become so brittle as to afford no safeguard
against ordinary accidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Often the cells must necessarily be of a large size, and for
this reason are made by taking four strips of glass of the
thickness and depth required, and grinding the places where
these are to meet with emery, so as to form a slightly
roughened but flat edge. The glass strip must also be
ground on the side where it meets the plate, and each piece
cemented with the marine glue mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a> in
the following manner:—On that part of the glass to which
another piece is to be attached should be laid thin strips of
the glue; both pieces must then be heated upon a small
brass table, with the aid of the spirit-lamp, until the strips
become melted; the small piece is then to be taken up and
placed upon the spot to which it is to be attached, and so
on until the cell is completed. It will be found necessary to
spread the glue over the surface required with a needle or
some other instrument, so that an unbroken line may be
presented to the wall of the cell, and no bubbles formed.
Too great a heat will “burn” the marine-glue, and render
it brittle; care must be therefore taken to avoid this.</p>

<p>When shallow cells are required, those which are made
by grinding a concavity in the middle of an ordinary slide
will be found very convenient. The concavities are cut both
circular and oblong; and the surface being flat, the cover is
easily fastened upon it. These are now cheap, and are very
safe as to leakage.</p>

<p>Circular cells with a flat bottom used to be made by
drilling a hole through glass of the required thickness, and
fixing this upon an ordinary slide with marine-glue; but
the danger of breakage and the labour were so great that
this method is seldom used now, and, indeed, the rings about
to be mentioned do away with all necessity of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glass Rings.</span>—Where any depth is required, no method
of making a cell for liquids is so convenient as the use of
glass rings, which are now easily and cheaply procurable.
They are made of almost every size and depth, and, except
in very extraordinary cases, the necessity for building cells
is completely done away with. These rings have both edges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
left roughened, and consequently adhere very well to the
slide, this adherence being generally accomplished by the
aid of marine glue, as before noticed with the glass cells.
Gold-size has been occasionally used for this purpose; and
the adherence, even with liquid in the cell, I have always
found to be perfect. This method has the advantage of
requiring no heat, but the gold-size must be perfectly dry,
and the ring must have been fixed upon the slide some time
before use. Canada balsam has also been used for the same
purpose, but cannot be recommended, as when it is perfectly
dry it becomes so brittle as to bear no shock to which the
slide may be ordinarily exposed.</p>

<p>These are the cells which are mostly used in this branch
of microscopic mounting. The mode of using them, and the
different treatment which certain objects require when intended
to be preserved in the before-mentioned liquids, may
now be inquired into.</p>

<p>I may mention, however, that this class of objects is
looked upon by many with great mistrust, owing to the
danger there is of bubbles arising in the cells after the
mounting has been completed, even for years. I know
some excellent microscopists who exclude all objects in cells
and preservative liquids from their cabinets, because they
say that eventually almost all become dry and worthless;
and this is no matter of surprise, for many of them do
really become so. Perhaps this is owing to the slides being
sold before they could possibly be thoroughly dry. As to
the air-bubbles, I shall have something to say presently.</p>

<p>We will now suppose the cell employed is made by
placing a glass ring upon the slide with marine glue or
gold-size, and is quite dry. Around the edge of the cleaned
thin glass which is to cover it, I trace with a camel-hair
pencil a ring of gold-size, and also around the edge of the
cell to which it is to adhere. Dr. Carpenter objects to this,
as rendering the later applications of the gold-size liable to
“run in.” All danger of this, however, is completely done
away with by leaving the slide and cover for awhile until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the cement becomes partially “fixed,” but still adhesive
enough to perform its function (<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a>). With many
slides this is not accomplished in less than twenty-four
hours, even if left two or three days no injury whatever
ensues; but with other kinds an hour is too long to leave
the exposed cement, so that the operator must use his own
discretion. The liquid required may be drawn up by the
mouth into the pointed tube mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a>, and
then transferred to the cell. In the various books of instruction,
the object is now to be placed in the cell; this,
however, I think a great mistake, as another process is
absolutely necessary before we advance so far. The cell,
full of liquid, must be placed under the receiver of an air-pump,
and the air withdrawn. Almost immediately it will
be perceived that the bottom and sides of the cell are
covered with minute bubbles, which are formed by the air
that is held in suspension by the liquid. The slide may
now be removed, and the bubbles may require the aid of a
needle or other point to displace them, so obstinately do
they adhere to the surface of the glass. This process may be
then repeated, and one cause, at least, of the appearance of
bubbles in cells of liquid will be got rid of. The object to
be mounted should also be soaked in one or two changes of
the preservative liquid employed, and, during the soaking,
be placed under the air-pump and exhausted. It may
then be transferred to the cell, which will probably
cause the liquid to overflow a little. The cover with the
gold size applied to the edge must then be carefully laid
upon the cell, and slightly pressed down, so that all air-bubbles
may be displaced. The two portions of gold-size
will now be found to adhere wherever the liquid does not
remain, although the whole ring may have been previously
wet. The outer edge of the thin glass and cell must now
be perfectly dried, and a coating of gold-size applied. When
this is dry, the process must be repeated until the cement
has body enough to protect the cell from all danger of
leakage. When some preservative liquids are used, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
scum is frequently found upon the surface when placed in
the cell, which must be removed immediately before the cover
is laid upon it.</p>

<p>I believe this method to be perfectly secure against
leakage when carefully performed; and some of my friends
have told me that their experience (some years) has been
equally satisfactory.</p>

<p>In using some of the particular kinds of preservative
liquids, it will be found necessary to make slight change
in the manipulation. This will be best explained by
mentioning a few objects, and the treatment they require.</p>

<p>For the preservation of the Mosses, Algæ, &amp;c., Deane’s
compound is much used, and considered one of the best
media. The specimen to be mounted should be immersed
in the compound, which must be kept fluid by the vessel
containing it being placed in hot water. In this state the
whole should be submitted to the action of the air-pump, as
it is not an easy matter to get rid of the bubbles which form
in and around the objects. The cell and slide must be
warmed; and heat will also be necessary to render the
gelatine, &amp;c., fluid enough to flow from the stock-bottle.
The cell may then be filled with the compound, and the
specimen immersed in it. A thin glass cover must then be
warmed, or gently breathed upon, and gradually lowered
upon the cell, taking care, as with all liquids, that no
bubbles are formed by the operation. The cover may be
fixed by the aid of gold-size, Japan, or any of the usual
varnishes, care being taken, as before, that all the compound
is removed from the parts to which the varnish is intended
to adhere.</p>

<p>The glycerine jelly of Mr. Lawrance, before mentioned,
requires almost a similar treatment. “The objects to be
mounted in this medium should be immersed for some time
in a mixture of equal parts of glycerine and dilute alcohol
(six of water to one of alcohol). The bottle of glycerine jelly
must be placed in a cup of hot water until liquefied, when it
must be used like Canada balsam, except that it requires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
less heat. A ring of asphaltum varnish round the thin glass
cover completes the mounting.”</p>

<p>The Infusoria (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>) are sometimes preserved
in liquid; but present many difficulties to the student.
Different kinds require different treatment, and consequently
it is well, when practicable, to mount similar objects in two
or more liquids. Some are best preserved in a strong
solution of chloride of calcium, others in Thwaites’ liquid,
whilst a few keep their colour most perfectly when in
glycerine alone. Many of them, however, are so very transparent
that they present but faint objects for ordinary
observance. The Desmidiaceæ require somewhat similar
treatment, and may be mentioned here. The solution of
chloride of calcium has been strongly recommended; but no
preservative liquid seems to be without some action upon
them. Both of the above classes of objects should be mounted
in shallow cells, so as to allow as high a microscopic power
as possible to be used with them.</p>

<p>Many of the <span class="smcap">Zoophytes</span> which are obtained on our sea-coasts
are well preserved by mounting in cells, in the manner
before mentioned, with Goadby’s fluid, or distilled water
with one of the additions noticed amongst the preservative
liquids. For examination by polarized light, however, they
are usually mounted in balsam (see <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>), whilst
those in cells present a more natural appearance as to
position, &amp;c., for common study.</p>

<p>As to the use of preservative liquids with the Diatomaceæ
there are various opinions. Some experienced microscopists
say that there is little or no satisfaction in mounting them
in this way. Dr. Carpenter, however, explains this difference
by his instructions as to what method should be used
when certain ends are desired. He says: “If they can be
obtained quite fresh, and it be desired that they should
exhibit as closely as possible the appearance presented by
the living plants, they should be put up in distilled water
within cement-cells; but if they are not thus mounted within
a short time after they have been gathered, about a sixth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
part of alcohol should be added to the water. If it be
desired to exhibit the stipitate forms in their natural parasitism
upon other aquatic plants, the entire mass may be
mounted in Deane’s gelatine in a deeper cell; and such a
preparation is a very beautiful object for the black-ground
illumination. If, on the other hand, the minute structure of
the siliceous envelopes is the feature to be brought into
view, the fresh diatoms must be boiled in nitric or hydrochloric
acid” (which process is fully described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter
II.</a>). It is very convenient to have many of these objects
mounted by two or more of the above methods; and if they
are to be studied, this is indispensable. Mr. Hepworth
once showed me about one hundred slides which he had
mounted in various ways, for no other purpose than the
study of the fly’s foot.</p>

<p>My friend, Mr. Rylands, successfully mounts the diatoms
in the state in which he finds them, and gave me the following
method as that which he always employs. He says
that he has had no failures, and hitherto has found his
specimens unchanged. Take a shallow ring cell of asphalt
or black varnish (which must be at least three weeks old),
and on the cell, whilst revolving, add a ring of benzole and
gold-size mixed in equal proportions. In a minute or two
pure distilled water is put in the cell until the surface is
slightly convex. The object having been already floated on
to the cover (the vessel used for this purpose being an ordinary
indian-ink palette), is now inverted and laid carefully
upon the water in the cell. By these means the object may
be laid down without being removed. The superfluous
moisture must not be ejected by pressure, but a wetted
camel-hair pencil, the size made in an ordinary quill, being
partially dried by drawing through the lips, must be used
repeatedly to absorb it, which the pencil will draw by
capillary attraction as it is very slowly turned round. When
the cover comes in contact with the benzole and gold-size ring,
there is no longer any fear of the object being removed, and
a slight pressure with the end of the cedar stick of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
pencil will render the adhesion complete, and cement the
cover closely and firmly to the cell. When dry, an outer
ring of asphalt makes the mounting neat and complete.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fungi</i> have been before mentioned; but it may be
here stated that some few of the minute forms are best preserved
in a very shallow cell of liquid. For this purpose
creosote-water may be advantageously used.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">antennæ</i> of insects have been before noticed as being
very beautiful when mounted in balsam. This is readily
accomplished when they are large; but those of the most
minute insects are much more difficult to deal with, and are
less liable to injury when put up in fluid. <em>Goadby’s Fluid</em>
serves this purpose very well; but, of course, the object
must be thoroughly steeped in the liquid before it is
mounted, for a longer or shorter time according to the
thickness.</p>

<p>The <em>eggs of insects</em> afford some worthy objects for the
microscope, amongst which may be mentioned those of the
common cabbage butterflies (small and great), the meadow-brown,
the puss-moth, the tortoiseshell butterfly, the bug,
the cow-dung fly, &amp;c. These, however, shrivel up on becoming
dry, and must, therefore, be preserved in some of
the fluids before mentioned. To accomplish this no particular
directions are required; but the soaking in the liquid
about to be employed, &amp;c., must be attended to as with other
objects.</p>

<p><em>Glycerine</em> may be advantageously used for the preservation
of various insects. These should first be cleaned with
alcohol to get rid of all extraneous matter, and then, after
soaking in glycerine, be mounted with it like other objects.
This liquid may also be used for the Entomostraca, which
offer a wide field for study. They are to be found abundantly
in ponds of stagnant water, &amp;c. Some insects, such
as May-flies, &amp;c., are, however, often preserved by immersion
in a solution of one part of chloride of calcium in
three or four parts of water; but this has not been recommended
amongst the “preservative liquids,” as the colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
which is often an attractive quality of this class of objects,
is thereby destroyed.</p>

<p>We have now noticed the treatment which must be applied
to those objects which are to be preserved in liquids
and cells. We may here state that all slides of this kind
should be examined at short intervals, as they will be found
now and then to require another coating of varnish round
the edge of the thin glass cover to prevent all danger of
leakage. The use of the air-pump, in the first instance
(as before recommended), and this precaution as to the
varnish, will render the slides less liable to leakage and air-bubbles,
which so very frequently render them almost
worthless.</p>

<span class="subhead">SECTIONS AND HOW TO CUT THEM, WITH SOME REMARKS ON
DISSECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Many</span> objects are almost worthless to the microscopist until
the extraneous matter is removed from them; and this is
frequently difficult in the extreme to perform satisfactorily.
As an instance, certain Foraminifera may be mentioned in
which the cells are placed one upon another, consequently
the object must be reduced to a certain degree of <em>thinness</em>
before a single uniform layer of these cells can be obtained
to show something of the internal arrangements.</p>

<p>Most animal and vegetable forms require an examination
of the separate parts before much can be known about
them. The mass must be divided into separate portions,
each part intended to be preserved being cleaned from the
useless matter with which it is surrounded. It will frequently
be found necessary to make thin sections, which
from a very tender substance is no easy matter; and much
patience will be necessary to attain anything like proficiency.</p>

<p>This making of sections was not until very recently
entered into by many except those belonging to the medical
profession, but I do not see why this should be so, as much
may be accomplished by a persevering and interested mind
where there is time for entering into the subject. I will
therefore make an attempt to give some instructions on this
subject also. We will first consider the cutting of sections
from hard substances, in which the ordinary knife, chisel,
&amp;c., are of no avail. Most of these require no particular
care in mounting, but are placed in balsam like the other
objects noticed in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>: where, however, any special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
treatment is necessary it will be commented upon as we
proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shells, &amp;c.</span>—It is seldom, if ever, necessary to possess
apparatus for this process except a small thin saw made
with a steel blade, for which a piece of watch-spring serves
very well; a fine stone such as is used for sharpening pen-knives;
and two smooth leather strops, one of which is to
be used with putty-powder to polish the section after
grinding, and the other dry, to give the final surface. It is,
however, very convenient to have three or four files of
different degrees of fineness. The shell, if very thick, may
be divided by using the watch-spring saw; and this section
may then with ordinary care be rubbed down with water on
the stone until one side of it is perfectly flat. When this is
accomplished it must be again rubbed with putty-powder
upon the strop, and finally upon the other strop without the
powder. This surface will then be finished and must be
firmly united to the slide in the position it is intended to
occupy. To do this a small quantity of Canada balsam may
be dropped upon the middle of the slide and heated over the
lamp until on cooling it becomes hard; but this must be
stopped before it is rendered brittle. Upon this the polished
surface must be laid, and sufficient heat applied to allow the
object to fall closely upon the slide, when slight pressure may
be used to force aside all bubbles, &amp;c. On cooling, the adherence
will be complete enough to allow the same grinding
and polishing upon the upper surface which the lower received.
Whilst undergoing this, the section must be examined from
time to time to ascertain whether the necessary degree of thinness
has been reached. When this is the case the section
should be washed thoroughly and dried. It must then be
covered, which is best done by using the ordinary Canada
balsam, as recommended in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a></p>

<p>Sections of some exquisitely beautiful objects are cut with
much less trouble than the above. The Orbitolite, for
instance, may be prepared in this manner. Take the
object and by pressure with the finger rub the side upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
a flat and smooth sharpening stone with water until the
portion is reached which it is wished to show. The
strength of the object will easily allow this to be accomplished
with ordinary care. This side may then be
attached to the glass slide with heated balsam, as above
described, and the object may then be gently rubbed down
to the degree of thinness required to show it to the best
advantage. After removing all disengaged matter from the
object by washing and thoroughly drying, it may be
mounted in balsam in the usual manner, when it is equally
beautiful as a transparent or opaque object. From this it
will be seen that in many instances where a smooth stone is
found sufficient for the work (which is often the case when
the section is mounted in balsam) the final process of polishing
advised above may be dispensed with, as in the Orbitolite,
Nummulite, &amp;c., &amp;c. It is quite necessary that the stones on
which the objects are rubbed be <em>perfectly flat</em>, otherwise one
side must be acted upon before the other, and it will be
found impossible to attain anything like uniformity. Where
it is not practicable to cut a section and the object is very
thick, a coarse stone may be first used to reduce it and the
smoother afterwards.</p>

<p>The consideration of the cutting of sections from shells
would scarcely be deemed complete without some mention
of what Dr. Carpenter terms the decalcifying process.
Muriatic acid is diluted with twenty times its volume of
water, and in this the shell is immersed. After a period,
differing according to the thickness of the shell, the carbonate
of lime will be dissolved away, and a peculiar membrane
left, showing the structure of the shell very perfectly.
This may be mounted dry, in balsam, or sometimes in
liquid, according to the appearance of the object; but no
rule can be given. The discretion of the student, however,
will enable him to choose the most suitable method.</p>

<p>From some shells it is easy to divide thin plates, or
“laminæ,” which require nothing but mounting in Canada
balsam to show the texture very well. In working, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
with those which are “pearly,” it will be found that experience
and patience are needed, as they are very brittle and
peculiarly hard; but a little practice will overcome these
difficulties.</p>

<p>Amongst the Echinodermata, which include the star-fishes,
sea-hedgehogs, &amp;c., there are many whose outer
surface is covered with “spines,” or thin projections. Some
of these are sharp and thorn-like, others blunt, longer or
shorter, and, indeed, of endless variety. In many of these,
when a section is made, rings are seen which have a common
centre, with radiating supports, resembling sections of
some of the woods. These are very beautiful objects, and
methods of procuring them may now be considered. It is
the best to cut as thin a section as can safely be got with
the watch-spring saw first, when the smooth “sharpening
stone” may be used to polish one side, which is easily
accomplished with water only. When this is effected, it
must be washed clean, and <em>thoroughly</em> dried, and then may
be united to the slide in the same manner as before recommended
for the Orbitolite, &amp;c. If it is ever necessary to
displace it on account of inequalities, bubbles, or other
remediable fault, this may be done by warming the slide;
though too much heat must be avoided, otherwise fresh
bubbles will certainly be produced. The covering with thin
glass, balsam, &amp;c., will present no difficulty to the student;
but he must remember that the transparency is somewhat
increased by this last operation.</p>

<p><em>Corals</em> are often treated in this way, in order to reveal
their structure. Except, however, the student has had
much practice, he will often find this a most difficult task,
as many of them are exceedingly brittle. He will find the
method before described equally applicable here, and should
take both horizontal and vertical sections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal.</span>—This substance is one of the most interesting
objects to the microscopist. It is, of course, of a vegetable
origin; and though this is in many cases of such minute
separate portions as to have lost all appearance of vegetation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
yet it is very frequently met with in masses, bearing the
form, even to the minute markings, of wood, in various
directions. To see this and prepare it for microscopic
research, a suitable piece of coal must be obtained; but in
every case the cutting and preparation of these sections
require great care and skill. Sometimes the coal is first
made smooth on one side, fastened to the glass, reduced to
the requisite degree of thinness, and finished in the method
before described. This mode of treating it is sometimes,
however, very tantalizing, as, at the last moment, when the
section is about thin enough, it often breaks up, and so
renders the trouble bestowed upon it fruitless. The dark
colour and opacity of coal render an extraordinary thinness
necessary, and so increase the liability to this accident.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best method which can be pursued is that
recommended in the “Micrographic Dictionary,” which is as
follows:—“The coal is macerated for about a week in a
solution of carbonate of potash; at the end of that time it
is possible to cut tolerably thin slices with a razor. These
slices are then placed in a watch-glass with strong nitric
acid, covered and gently heated; they soon turn brownish,
then yellow, when the process must be arrested by dropping
the whole into a saucer of cold water, else the coal would be
dissolved. The slices thus treated appear of a darkish
amber colour, very transparent, and exhibit the structure,
when existing, most clearly. We have obtained longitudinal
and transverse sections of coniferous wood from various
coals in this way. The specimens are best preserved in
<em>glycerine</em> in cells; we find that spirit renders them opaque,
and even Canada balsam has the same defect. Schulz
states that he has brought out the cellulose reaction with
iodine, in coal treated with nitric acid and chlorate of
potash.”</p>

<p><em>Cannel-coal</em> is so close and firm in its structure as to
be much used instead of jet in the manufacture of ornaments:
it takes a beautiful polish, and consequently presents
the student with none but ordinary difficulties in getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
sections of it. Its formation is somewhat different from
that of coal, sometimes showing the transition very clearly.</p>

<p>In <em>flint</em> there are often found remains of sponges, shells,
Diatomaceæ, &amp;c.; but to show these well, sections must be
cut and polished by the lathe and wheel of the lapidary, which
the microscopic student seldom possesses. Thin chippings
may, however, be made, which when steeped in turpentine
and mounted in balsam, will frequently show these remains
very well.</p>

<p><em>Teeth</em> are very interesting objects to all microscopists,
more especially to those who give much study to them; as
the class of animal may very frequently be known from one
solitary remaining tooth. To examine them thoroughly, it
is necessary to cut sections of them; but this is rather difficult
to perform well, and needs some experience. Some
instructions, however, will at least lessen these difficulties,
and we will now endeavour to give them.</p>

<p>It is generally thought that Canada balsam injures the
finer markings of these sections, consequently, they are
almost invariably mounted <em>dry</em>. A thin piece is first cut
from the tooth with the saw of watch-spring before
mentioned, if possible; but should the substance be too hard
for this, the wheel and lathe must be used with diamond
dust. If this cannot be procured, there is no alternative
but to rub down the whole substance as thin as practicable
on some coarse stone or file. The surface will then be rough;
but this may be much reduced by rubbing upon a flat sharpening
stone with the finger, or a small piece of gutta-percha,
upon the object to keep it in contact. The scratches may
be much lessened by this, but not so thoroughly removed as
microscopic examination requires in dry sections. It must,
therefore, be polished with the putty-powder and dry strop,
as recommended in the working of the shell-sections. The
other side of the section of the tooth may then be rubbed
down to the requisite thinness, and polished in the same
manner, when the dust and other impurities must be removed
by washing, after which the section must be carefully dried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and mounted. Some of these sections are equally interesting
as opaque or transparent objects.</p>

<p>The dentine of the teeth may be decalcified by submersion
of the section in dilute muriatic acid; after drying and
mounting in Canada balsam it presents a new and interesting
appearance, showing the enamel fibres very beautifully
when magnified about three hundred diameters. A friend
tells me that after submersion of the <em>whole tooth</em> in the acid
he has been able to cut sections with a razor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sections of Bone.</span>—With the aid of the microscope few
fragmentary remains have proved so useful to the geologist
and students of the fossil kingdom as these. From a single
specimen many of our naturalists can tell with certainty to
what <em>class</em> of animal it has once belonged. To arrive at
this point of knowledge much study is necessary, and sections
of various kinds should be cut in such a manner as will best
exhibit the peculiarities of formation. The methods of
accomplishing this will now be considered. It may, however,
be first mentioned that the chippings of some bones will be
found useful now and then, as before stated with flint,
though this is by no means a satisfactory way of proceeding.
Sometimes the bones may be procured naturally so thin that
they may be examined without any cutting; and only
require mounting <em>dry</em>, or in <em>fluid</em>, as may be found the
best.</p>

<p>When commencing operations we must provide the same
apparatus as is needed in cutting sections of teeth, before
described. A fine saw, like those used for cutting brass, &amp;c.;
two or three flat files of different degrees of coarseness;
two flat “sharpening” stones; and a leather strop with
putty-powder for polishing. As thin a section as possible
should first be cut from the part required by the aid of the
fine saw; and it is better when in this state to soak it for
some short time in camphine, ether, or some other spirit to
free it from all grease. With the aid of a file we may
now reduce it almost to the necessary degree of thinness,
and proceed as before recommended with teeth. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
“sharpening” stone will remove all scratches and marks
sufficiently to allow it to be examined with the microscope
to see if it is ground thin enough; and if it is to be mounted
<em>dry</em> we must polish it with putty-powder and water upon
the strop to as high a degree as possible, and having washed
all remains of polishing powder, &amp;c., from the section we
must place it upon the slide and finish it as described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II.</a></p>

<p>If the bone is not sufficiently hard in its nature to bear
the above method of handling whilst grinding and polishing—as
some are far more brittle than others—as thin a section
as possible must first be cut with the saw, and one surface
ground and polished. The piece must then be dried and
united to the glass by heated balsam in the same manner
as shells, &amp;c. After which the superabundance of balsam
must be removed from the glass; then rub down upon the
stone and strop as before. When the polishing is completed
the whole slide must be immersed in chloroform, ether, or
some other spirit, to release and cleanse the section, when
it may be mounted as the one above mentioned.</p>

<p>Some have recommended a strong solution of isinglass
to affix the half-ground teeth or bones to the glass as
causing them to adhere very firmly and requiring no heat,
and also being readily detached when finished.</p>

<p>The reason why the sections of bone are usually mounted
<em>dry</em> is that the “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lacunæ</i>,” bone cells, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">canaliculi</i> (resembling
minute canals) show their forms, &amp;c., very perfectly
in this state, as they are hollow and contain air, whereas
if they become filled with liquid or balsam—which does
sometimes occur—they become almost indistinguishable.
There are some dark specimens, however, where the cells
are already filled with other matter, and it is well to mount
these with balsam and so gain a greater degree of transparency.</p>

<p>To gain a true knowledge of the structure of bone,
sections must be cut as in wood, both transversely and
longitudinally; but with <i>fossil</i> bones, without the lapidary’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
wheel, &amp;c., it is a laborious task, and indeed can seldom be
properly accomplished. In this place, also, it may be
mentioned that by submitting bone to the action of muriatic
acid diluted ten or fifteen times with water, the lime, &amp;c., is
dissolved away and the cartilage is left, which may be cut
into sections: in <i>caustic potash</i> the animal matter is got
rid of. Both of these preparations may be mounted in
fluid.</p>

<p>The method of cutting thin sections of bone may be also
employed with the stones of fruit, vegetable ivory and such
like substances; many of which show a most interesting
arrangement of cells, especially when the sections are transverse.
Most of these objects present a different appearance
when mounted <i>dry</i> to that which they bear when <i>in balsam</i>,
owing to the cells becoming filled; and to arrive at a true
knowledge of them we must have a specimen mounted in
both ways.</p>

<p>To those who study polarized light, few objects are more
beautiful than the sections of the different kinds of horn.
We will briefly inquire into the best method of cutting these.
There are three kinds of horn, the first of which is hard,
as the stag’s, and must be cut in the same manner as bone.
The second is somewhat softer, as the cow’s. The third is
another and still softer formation, as the “horn” (as it is
termed) of the rhinoceros. In cutting sections of the two
last we should succeed best by using the machine invented
for these purposes which I shall shortly describe when the
method of cutting wood is considered. To aid us in this
when the horn is hard it must be boiled for a short time in
water, when the cutting will be more easily accomplished.
The sections should be both transverse and longitudinal,
those of the former often showing cells with beautiful crosses,
the colours with the selenite plate being truly splendid. Of
this class the rhinoceros horn is one of the best; but the
buffalo also affords a very handsome object. The cow’s, and
indeed almost every different kind of horn, well deserves the
trouble of mounting. Whalebone, when cut transversely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
strongly resembles those of the third and softer formation. All
these are best seen when mounted in Canada balsam, but
care must be taken that they have been thoroughly dried
after cutting, and then steeped in turpentine.</p>

<p>An interesting object may also be procured from whalebone
by cutting long sections of the hairs of which it is
composed. Down the centre of each hair we shall find a
line of cells divided from one another very distinctly. And
(as recommended in the “Micrographic Dictionary”) if
whalebone be macerated twenty-four hours in a solution of
caustic potash it will be softened, and by afterwards digesting
in water, the outer part will be resolved into numerous
transparent cells, which will show more plainly the structure
of this curious substance.</p>

<p>In a former chapter, hairs were mentioned, their many and
interesting forms, and their beauty when used with polarized
light. The sections of them, however, are no less a matter
of study, as this mode of treatment opens to sight the outer
“casing,” and the inner substance somewhat resembling the
pith of plants.</p>

<p>It would be out of place to enter into the description
of the different forms met with; but the ways in which
sections are to be procured may be glanced at. If transverse
sections are required, some place a quantity of hairs
betwixt two flat pieces of cork, which by pressure hold them
firmly enough together to allow the required portions to be
cut with a razor. Others take a bundle of the hairs and dip
it into gum or glue, which gives it when dry a solidity equal
to wood. Sections of this are then cut with the machine
mentioned a little further on, and these may be mounted in
balsam. The human hair is easily procured in the desired
sections by shaving as closely as possible a second time and
cleansing from the lather, &amp;c., by carefully washing. Most
hairs, however, should be examined both transversely and longitudinally.
It is not difficult to procure the latter, as we
may generally split them with the aid of a sharp razor. In
a great number of hairs there is a quantity of greasy matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
which must be got rid of by soaking in ether or some other
solvent before mounting.</p>

<p>We may next consider the best method of procuring
<em>sections of wood</em>, which must be cut of such a degree of
thinness as to form transparent objects, and so display all
the secrets of their structure. There is no monotony in
this study, as the forms are so various, and the arrangement
of the cells and woody fibre so different, that the
microscopist may find endless amusement or study in
it. From a single section the <em>class</em> of trees to which it
has belonged may be known, often even when the wood is
<em>fossil</em>. The apparatus best adapted for cutting these
sections is made as follows:—A flat piece of hard wood,
about six inches long, four wide, and one thick, is chosen,
to which another of the same size is firmly fixed, so as to
form, in a side view, the letter <span class="sans">T</span>. On one end of the upper
surface is fastened a brass plate, perfectly flat, in the centre
of which a circular opening is cut about half an inch in
diameter. Coinciding with this opening is a brass tube,
fixed in the under side of the table (if it may be termed so).
This tube is so cut at the bottom as to take a fine screw.
Another screw is also placed at the same end of the “table,”
which works at right angles to this, so that any substance
in the tube may be wedged firmly by working this last
screw. To use this instrument, the piece of wood or other
object of which a section is required must be placed in the
tube, when, by turning the screw underneath, the wood is
raised above the brass plate more or less as wished, and by
using the screw at the end, it is held firmly in the same
position. With a flat chisel the portion of the object which
projects above the surface of the brass plate may now be
cut off, and by means of the bottom screw another portion
may be raised and treated in the same manner. As to the
thickness of which objects should be cut, no proper directions
can be given, as this differs so greatly that nothing but
experience can be any guide. The same thickness can be
obtained by working the screw underneath in uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
degrees, the head being marked for this purpose; and when
the substance to be cut is <em>very</em> much smaller than the hole
in the brass plate, it may be wedged with cork.</p>

<p>As this instrument is peculiarly adapted for cutting wood
(though used for other substances, as before mentioned), I
shall notice a few particulars concerning this branch of
sections. It may here be remarked, that to obtain anything
like a true knowledge of the nature of wood, it should be
cut and examined in at least two directions, <em>across</em> and
<em>along</em>. The piece of wood is often placed in spirits for a
day or two, so that all resinous matter may be dissolved
out of it; it must then be soaked in water for the same
length of time, so as to soften and render it easy to cut.
Sections are obtained in the manner described above,
but often curl to such a degree as to make it necessary to
immerse them in water, from which they may be taken and
dried under slight pressure. They are often mounted <em>dry</em>,
and require no care beyond other objects, as in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter
II.</a> Some, however, are best mounted in balsam, particularly
the long sections when used for the polariscope;
these must be soaked in turpentine, and the greatest
care taken that all air bubbles are got rid of. Others are
thought to be most useful when mounted in shallow cells
with some of the <em>preservative liquids</em> mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter
IV.</a>—weak spirit and water, chloride of calcium solution
of the strength of one part of the salt to three parts of
distilled water, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The above “<em>section-cutter</em>” may not be within the reach
of every student, nor is it absolutely necessary; though
where any <em>great number</em> of specimens is required it is very
useful, and insures greater uniformity in the thickness.
Many employ a razor for the purpose, which must always
be kept sharp by frequent stropping. Sections of
leaves also may be procured by the same means, though,
as before mentioned, they are sometimes easily divided by
stripping the coatings off with the fingers. The cells
which come to sight by cutting some of the orchideous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
plants are most interesting. To cut these leaves they may
be laid upon a flat piece of cork, thus exposing the razor
to no danger of injury by coming in contact with the
support. It may be mentioned here that the <em>razor</em> may
also be used in cutting sections of the rush, than which a
more beautiful object can scarcely be found when viewed
transversely, as it shows the stellate arrangements of the
ducts to convey the liquids to the different parts of the
plant very clearly. This should be mounted <em>dry</em>. In the
same way sections of the leaf-stalks of ferns may also be
cut, some of which, as Dr. Carpenter states, show the
curious ducts very beautifully, especially when cut rather
obliquely.</p>

<p>When sections of the softer substances are required, no
instrument can be compared with “Valentin’s knife,” which
consists of two steel blades lying parallel with one another
and attached at the lower end. The distance of separation
may be regulated at will by a small screw near the handle.
When, therefore, a section is wanted, the substance must be
cut through, and betwixt the blades a thin strip will be
found, which may be made of any thickness, according to
the distance of their separation. By loosening the screw
the blades may be extended, and the section may be floated
out in water if the damp will not injure it. The knife cuts
much better if dipped in water immediately before use and
also when the substance to be operated upon is wet, or even
under water altogether; but care must be taken, after use,
to clean the blades thoroughly and oil them before laying
by, if the place is at all damp. This instrument is most
useful in such subjects as anatomical preparations where
the sections are required to show the position of the different
vessels, &amp;c.; but, as before stated, is very valuable for all
soft substances. As an instance of this, it may be mentioned,
that it is frequently used in cutting sections of sponges;
but as these are often very full of spicula, &amp;c., it is much
better to press the sponge flat until dry, and then cut off
thin shavings with a very sharp knife; these shavings will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
expand when placed in water. After this they may be laid
betwixt two flat surfaces and dried, when they may be
mounted as other dry objects, or, when desirable, in balsam.</p>

<p><em>Valentin’s knife</em> is very much used in taking sections of
skin, which are afterwards treated with potash solution,
acids, &amp;c., to bring out in the best way the different portions.
Dr. Lister’s mode, however, of getting these is thus
given in the <cite>Microscopic Journal</cite>:—“But I afterwards
found that much better sections could be obtained from
dried specimens. A portion of shaved scalp being placed
between two thin slips of deal, a piece of string is tied
round them so as to exercise a slight degree of compression;
the preparation is now laid aside for twenty-four hours,
when it is found to be dried to an almost horny condition.
It then adheres firmly by its lower surface to one of the
slips, and thus it can be held securely, while extremely thin
and equable sections are cut with great facility in any plane
that may be desired. These sections, when moistened with
a drop of water and treated with acetic acid, are as well
suited for the investigation of the muscular tissue as if they
had not been dried.”</p>

<p>There are many who almost confine their attention to
polarized light and its beautiful effects. Such would not
deem these efforts to aid the student in cutting sections
complete without some notice of those which are taken
from various crystals, in order to display that curious and
beautiful phenomenon, <em>the rings with a cross</em>. The arrangement
of these is somewhat changed by the crystal which
affords the section; but nitrate of potash gives two sets of
rings with a cross, the long line of which passes through
both, the short line dividing it in the middle.</p>

<p>The process of cutting these sections is rather difficult,
but a little care and perseverance will conquer all this.
The following is extracted from the <cite>Encyclopædia Metropolitana</cite>:—“Nitre
crystallizes in long six-sided prisms
whose section, perpendicular to their sides, is the regular
hexagon. They are generally very much interrupted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
their structure; but by turning over a considerable quantity
of the ordinary saltpetre<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> of the shops specimens are readily
found which have perfectly transparent portions of some
extent. Selecting one of these, cut it with a knife into a
plate <em>above</em> a quarter of an inch thick, directly across the
axis of the prism, and then grind it down on a broad wet
file till it is reduced to about one quarter or a sixth of an
inch thick, smooth the surface on a wet piece of emeried
glass, and polish on a piece of silk strained very tight over
a strip of plate-glass, and rubbed with a mixture of tallow
and colcothar of vitriol. This operation requires practice.
It cannot be effected unless the nitre be applied wet and
rubbed till quite dry, increasing the rapidity of the friction
as the moisture evaporates. It must be performed in gloves,
as the vapour from the fingers, as well as the slightest
breath, dims the polished surface effectually. With these
precautions a perfect vitreous polish is easily obtained.
We may here remark, that hardly any two salts can be
polished by the same process. Thus, Rochelle-salt must be
finished wet on the silk, and instantly transferred to soft
bibulous linen and rapidly rubbed dry. Experience alone
can teach these peculiarities, and it is necessary to resort
to contrivances (sometimes very strange ones) for the
purpose of obtaining good polished sections of soft crystals,
especially of those easily soluble in water.</p>

<p>“The nitre is thus polished on both its surfaces, which
should be brought as near as possible to parallelism.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> Sometimes the saltpetre of the shops is nitrate of <em>soda</em>, and as
this is slightly deliquescent, it is well to be certain that we have the
nitrate of <em>potash</em>, which is free from this defect.</p></div>

<p>Some sections of the naturally formed crystals also show
the “rings” very well,—as Iceland Spar, which gives a
single ring and cross; but the difficulty of cutting and
polishing them is almost too great for the amateur, and
must be left to the lapidary. This curious phenomenon,
however, may be seen by using a plate of ice uninterruptedly
formed of about one inch in thickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Before concluding these remarks on sections, I must mention
a few difficulties which may be met with, and their
remedies. The foremost of these is the softness of some
objects, which have not resistance enough in themselves to
bear cutting even with the sharpest instruments. This
may often be removed by soaking in a solution of gum, and
then drying, which will render the substance firm enough
to be cut, when the sections must be steeped in water, and
the gum thus got rid of. Small seeds, &amp;c., may be placed
in wax when warmed, and will be held firmly enough when
it is again cold to allow of them being cut into sections, &amp;c.
And, lastly, where a substitute for a microscopist’s hand-vice
is required, a cork which fits any tube large enough may be
taken and split, the object being then placed between the
two parts, and the cork thrust into the tube, a sufficient
degree of firmness will be obtained to resist any necessary
cutting, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dissection.</span>—As I stated at the commencement of this
chapter, no written instructions can enable any student to
become an adept in this branch without much experience
and no little study. I will, however, describe the necessary
apparatus, and afterwards mention the mode of treatment
which certain objects require.</p>

<p>A different microscope is manufactured for the purpose of
dissection, most first-rate makers having their own model.
The object-glasses of many of these are simple, and consequently
not expensive; but one of the great requisites is a
stage large enough to hold the trough, in which the operation
is often performed. Where this is the case it would scarcely
be worth the expense of getting a dissecting microscope if
the student were pursuing no particular study, but merely
made use of the instrument when an object to be operated
upon turned up accidentally. The ordinary form is much
improved for this purpose, by having two wooden rests
placed at the sides of the microscope, upon which the hands
may be supported when working upon the stage. These
should be weighty enough to be free from danger of moving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
These supports will also be found to be a remedy against much
of the weariness which inevitably arises from having to
sustain the hands as well as work with them. The erector,
as I before observed, is necessary to a young student; but
with a little practice he may work very well without it.</p>

<p>We will now notice some of the instruments which are
most useful in dissection. Two or three different sizes of
ordinary scissors should be possessed, but the shapes
must be modified in others for many purposes, as those
used by surgeons; a pair with the cutting parts bent in a
horizontal direction, and another pair slightly curved in a
perpendicular; so that parts of the substance operated upon
may be reached, which it would be impossible to touch with
straight scissors. One point of these is sometimes blunt,
and the other acute, being thus made very useful in
opening tubular formations. Another form of these is made,
where the blades of the scissors are kept open by a spring,
the handles being pressed together by the fingers. Where
it is desirable, one or both of these handles may be lengthened
to any degree by the addition of small pieces of wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Knives</span> which are most useful are those of the
smallest kind which surgeons employ in very delicate operations.
These are made about the length of an ordinary pen-knife,
and are fixed in rather long flattish handles; some
are curved inwards, like the blade of a scythe, others backwards;
some taper to a point, whilst others again are broad
and very much rounded. Complete boxes are now fitted up
by the cutlers, of excellent quality and surprisingly cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Needles.</span>—These are very useful and should be firmly
fixed in handles as recommended in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I.</a> It is
convenient to have them of various lengths and thicknesses.
If curved by heating and bending to any required shape
they may be re-hardened by putting them whilst hot into
cold water. Dr. Carpenter also makes edged instruments by
rubbing down needles upon a hone. They are more
pleasant to work with when <em>short</em>, as the spring they have
whilst <em>long</em> robs them of much of their firmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
A <em>glass syringe</em> is also useful in many operations,
serving not only to cleanse the objects but to add or
withdraw liquids from the <em>dissecting-trough</em>. This trough
will now be described, as many substances are so changed
by becoming dry that it is impossible to dissect them
unless they are immersed in water during the operation.
If the object is opaque and must be worked by reflected
light, a small square trough may be made to the required
size of gutta-percha, which substance will not injure the
edge of the knives, &amp;c.; but where transparency is
necessary, a piece of thin plate-glass must be taken, and by
the aid of marine glue (as explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>) the
sides affixed of the required depth. As pins, &amp;c., cannot be
used with the glass troughs and the substance must be kept
extended, a thin sheet of cork loaded with lead in order to
keep it under water may be used; but this, of course, renders
the bottom opaque. When working with many thin substances,
a plate of glass three or four inches long and two
wide will serve every purpose, and be more pleasant to use
than the trough. A drop or two of water will be as much
liquid as is needed, and this will lie very well upon the flat
surface. As these are the principal apparatus and arrangements
which are requisite in dissection, the method of
proceeding in a few cases may now be noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetables.</span>—The dissection of vegetable matter is much
less complicated than that of animal; maceration in water
being a great assistant, and in many cases removing all
necessity for the use of the knife. This maceration may be
assisted by needles, and portions of the matter which are not
required may be removed by them. When, for instance,
the spiral vessels which are found in rhubarb are wanted,
some parts containing these are chosen and left in a small
quantity of water until the mass becomes soft, and this
is more quickly effected when the water is not changed.
The mass must be then placed upon a glass plate when practicable,
or in the trough when large, and with the aid of two
needles the matter may be removed from the spiral vessels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
which are plainly seen with a comparatively low power; and
by conveying these to a clean slip of glass, repeating the
process, and at last washing well, good specimens may be procured.
Most of these should be mounted in some of the preservative
liquids in the manner described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>
Many, however, may be dried on the slide, immersed in
turpentine, and then mounted in balsam; but liquid is
preferable, as it best preserves the natural appearance.
Certain kinds of vegetables require a different treatment to
separate these spiral vessels. Asparagus is composed of
very hard vegetable matter, and some have recommended
the stems to be first boiled, which will soften them to such a
degree that they may easily be separated. Dilute acids are
also occasionally used to effect this; and in some instances to
obtain the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">raphides</i> caustic potash may be employed; but after
<em>any</em> of these agents have been made use of, the objects must
be thoroughly cleansed with water, else the dissecting
instruments (and perhaps the cell) will be injured by the
action of the remaining portion of the softening agent.</p>

<p>For the dissection of <em>animal tissues</em> it is necessary that
the instruments be in the best order as to sharpness, &amp;c.;
and as the rules to be observed must necessarily be somewhat
alike in many instances, the treatment required by
some of the objects most frequently mounted will now be
described. We may here remark that <em>cartilage</em> can be best
examined by taking sections, which will show the arrangement
of the cells very perfectly. This, however, is plainly
seen in the mouse’s ear without any section being necessary.
Glycerine, the preservative liquids before mentioned, and
Canada balsam are all used to mount it; but perhaps
the first named may be preferred in many cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscle.</span>—This is what is commonly called the “flesh”
of animals. If a piece be laid upon the slide under the
microscope, bundles of “fibres” will be perceived, which
with needles and a little patience may be separated into
portions, some of these being “striated,” or marked with
alternate spaces of dark and light. Some of the <em>non-striated</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
or <em>smooth</em> class of muscle, such as is found in
intestines, may be prepared for the microscope by immersing
for a day or two in nitric acid diluted with three or four
parts of water, and then separating with needles and mounting
as soon as possible. Sometimes <em>boiling</em> is resorted to
to facilitate the separation, and occasions little or no alteration
in the material. Specimens are often taken from the
<em>frog</em> and the <em>pig</em>, as being amongst the best, <em>Goadby’s
solution</em> being generally used in mounting them. The
muscle of insects also shows the striæ very perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nerve-tissue.</span>—This is seldom mounted; as Dr. Carpenter
observes, “no method of preserving the nerve-tissue has
been devised which makes it worth while to mount preparations
for the sake of displaying its minute characters,”
but we will mention a few particulars to be observed in its
treatment. The nerve should be taken from the animal as
soon as possible after death, and laid upon a glass slide,
with a drop or two of serum if possible. The needles may
be used to clean it, but extreme delicacy is necessary. It
will be found that the nerve is tubular and filled with a
substance which is readily ejected by very slight pressure.
When the nerve is submitted to the action of acetic acid,
the outer covering, which is very thin, is considerably contracted,
whilst the inner tube is left projecting; and thus is
most distinctly shown the nature of the arrangement. Mr.
Lockhart Clarke, who has made great researches into the
structure of the spinal cord, gives a part of his experience
as follows:—He takes a perfectly fresh spinal cord and
submits it to the action of strong spirits of wine. This
gives the substance such a degree of hardness that thin
sections may be readily cut from it, which should be placed
upon a glass in a liquid consisting of three parts of spirit
and one of acetic acid, which renders them very distinct.
To mount these sections, they must now be steeped in pure
spirit for two hours and afterwards in oil of turpentine,
and lastly must be mounted in Canada balsam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tracheæ of Insects, &amp;c.</span>—The nature of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
was described in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a>, but the method of procuring
them was not explained, as this clearly belongs to
“dissection.” The larger tubes are readily separated by
placing the insect in water, and fixing as firmly as possible,
when the body must be opened and the viscera removed.
The tracheæ may then be cleaned by the aid of a camel-hair
pencil, and floated upon a glass, where they must first be
allowed to dry, and then be mounted in balsam. Mr. Quekett
gives the following method of removing the tracheæ from the
larva of an insect:—“Make a small opening in its body,
and then place it in strong acetic acid. This will soften
or decompose all the viscera, and the tracheæ may then be
well washed with the syringe, and removed from the body
with the greatest facility, by cutting away the connections
of the main tubes with the spiracles by means of fine-pointed
scissors. In order to get them upon the slide, it
must be put into the fluid, and the tracheæ floated upon it;
after which they may be laid out in their proper position,
then dried and mounted in balsam.” If we wish them to
bear their <em>natural</em> appearance, they must be mounted in a
cell with Goadby’s fluid; but the structure is <em>sometimes</em>
well shown in specimens mounted dry. As before mentioned,
these tracheæ terminate on the outside in openings
termed spiracles, which are round, oblong, and of various
shapes. Over these are generally a quantity of minute
hairs, forming a guard against the entrance of dust, &amp;c.
The forms of these are seldom alike in two different kinds
of insects, so that there is here a wide field for the student.
The dissection, moreover, is very easy, as they may be cut
from the body with a sharp knife or scissors, and mounted
in balsam or fluid. Many of the larvæ afford good specimens,
as do also some of the common Coleopterous insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tongues, or Palates, of Molluscs.</span>—Of the nature of
these, Dr. Carpenter gives the following description:—“The
organ which is commonly known under this designation is
one of a very singular nature; and we should be altogether
wrong in conceiving of it as having any likeness to that on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
which our ordinary ideas of such an organ are founded.
For, instead of being a projecting body, lying in the cavity
of the mouth, it is a tube that passes backwards and downwards
beneath the mouth, its higher end being closed,
whilst in front it opens obliquely upon the floor of the
mouth, being, as it were, slit up and spread out so as to
form a nearly flat surface. On the interior of the tube, as
well as on the flat expansion of it, we find numerous transverse
rows of minute teeth, which are set upon flattened
plates; each principal tooth sometimes having a basal plate
of its own, whilst in other instances one plate carries
several teeth.” These palates, or tongues, differ much
amongst the Gasteropods in form and size, some of them
being comparatively of an immense length. Many are
amongst the most beautiful objects when examined with
polarized light. They must, however, be procured by dissection,
which is usually performed as follows:—The animal
is placed on the cork in the dissecting-trough before mentioned,
and the head and forepart cut open, spread out, and
firmly pinned down. With the aid of fine scissors or knife,
the tongue must be then detached from its fastenings, and
placed in water for a day or two, when all foreign matter may
with a little care be removed. In what way it should be
mounted will depend on the purpose for which it is intended.
If for examination as an ordinary object, it may be laid
upon the slide and allowed to dry, which arrangement will
show the teeth very well. If we wish to see it as it is naturally,
it must be mounted in a cell with Goadby’s fluid; but
if it is wanted as a polarizing object, it must be floated upon
a slide, allowed to dry thoroughly, and then Canada
balsam added in the usual manner.</p>

<p>In the stomach, also, of some of these molluscs teeth are
found, which are very interesting objects to examine, and
must be dissected out in the same manner as the
“tongues.”</p>

<p>Since writing the above. Dr. Alcock (whose very beautiful
specimens prove him to be a great authority in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
branch) has published some of his experience in the second
volume of the third series of “Memoirs of the Literary
and Philosophical Society of Manchester.” By his permission
I make the following <span class="locked">extract:—</span></p>

<p>“This closes my present communication on the tongues
of mollusca; but as some members may possibly feel
inclined to enter upon the inquiry themselves, I think
it will not be amiss to add a few remarks on the manner
in which they are to be obtained.</p>

<p>“First, as to the kinds best worth the trouble of preparation.
Whelks, Limpets, and Trochuses should be taken
first. Land and fresh-water snails can scarcely be recommended,
except as a special study,—their tongues being
rather more difficult to find, and the teeth so small that
they require a high power to show them properly. It
would appear, from Spallanzani’s description of the anatomy
of the head of the snail, that even he did not make out
this part, although, in his curious observations on the reproduction
of lost parts, he must have carefully dissected
more snails than any other man.</p>

<p>“As to preserving the animals till wanted, they should
simply be dropped alive into glycerine or alcohol. Glycerine
is perhaps best where only the tongues are wanted;
but it leaves the animals very soft; and as it does not
harden their mucus at all, they are very slippery and
difficult to work upon when so preserved.</p>

<p>“Then as to the apparatus required for dissection. In the
first place, all the work is to be done under water, and a
common saucer is generally the most convenient vessel
to use. No kind of fastening down or pinning out of the
animal is needed; and, in fact, it is much better to have
it quite free, that you may turn it about any way you wish.
The necessary instruments are a needle-point, a pair
of fine-pointed scissors, and small forceps; the forceps
should have their points slightly turned in towards
each other.</p>

<p>“A word or two on the lingual apparatus generally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
and on its special characters in a few different animals,
will conclude what I have to say.</p>

<p>“The mode of using the tongue can be easily seen in
any of the common water-snails, when they are crawling
on the glass sides of an aquarium; it may then be observed
that from between the fleshy lips a thick mass is
protruded, with a motion forwards and upwards, and afterwards
withdrawn, these movements being almost continually
repeated. The action has the appearance of licking; but
when the light falls suitably on the protruded structure,
it is seen to be armed with a number of bright points,
which are the lingual teeth, so arranged as to give the
organ the character and action of a rasp.</p>

<p>“If you proceed to dissection, and open the head of one
of these mollusca (say, for instance, a common limpet), you
will find the cavity of the mouth almost filled with the
thick fleshy mass, the front of which is protruded in the
act of feeding; and on its upper surface, extending along
the middle line from back to front, is seen the strong
membranous band upon which the teeth are set. The
mass itself consists of a cartilaginous frame, surrounded
by strong muscles; and these structures constitute the
whole of the active part of the lingual apparatus....</p>

<p>“But the peculiarity of the toothed membrane, which
makes its name of ‘<em>ribbon</em>’ so appropriate, is, that there
is always a considerable length of it behind the mouth,
perfectly formed, and ready to come forward and supply
the place of that at the front, which is continually wearing
away by use.</p>

<p>“In the limpet this reserve-ribbon is of great length,
being nearly twice as long as the body, and the whole
of it is exposed to view on simply removing the foot of
the animal; nothing, then, can be easier than to extract
the tongue of the common limpet. But, unfortunately,
what you find in one kind of mollusc is not at all what
you find in another. In the Acmæas, for instance, which
are very closely related to the limpets, and have shells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
which cannot be distinguished, the reserve portion of the
ribbon has to be dug out from the substance of the liver,
in which it is imbedded, that organ being, as it were,
stitched completely through by a long loop of it....
It might be thought a comfortable reflection that, at all
events, one end of the ribbon can always be found in the
mouth; but in many cases this is about the worst place
to look for it. Perhaps it may appear strange that in
some of the smaller species, with a retractile trunk, a
beginner may very likely fail altogether in his attempt to
find the mouth; if, however, the skin of the back is removed,
commencing just behind the tentacles, there will be
very little difficulty in making out the trunk, which either
contains the whole of the ribbon, as in the whelk, or the
front part of it, as in <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Purpura</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Murex</i>, where a free
coil is also seen to hang from its hinder extremity....
In the periwinkles the same plan of proceeding, by at once
opening the back of the animal, is best; and on doing so,
the long ribbon, coiled up like a watch-spring, cannot fail
to be found.</p>

<p>“In the Trochuses, and indeed in all the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scutibranchiata</i>,
one point of the scissors should be introduced into the
mouth of the animal, and an incision made directly backwards
in the middle line above to some distance behind the
tentacles; the tongue is then immediately brought into
view, lying along the floor of the mouth.”</p>

<p>Dr. Alcock’s method of dissection will be found to differ
in some degree from the general rules before given; and
when the tongue is dissected out he washes it for one hour
(shaking it now and then) in a weak solution of potash.
After cleaning thoroughly in water, it must be mounted by
one of the methods before mentioned.</p>

<p>Amongst insects, especially the grasshopper tribe, are
found many which possess a gizzard, armed with strong
teeth, somewhat similar to those of the molluscs. It
requires great nicety of manipulation to obtain these for
the microscope; but it would be useless to attempt any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
description of the process here, as the strident can only be
successful by experience in dissecting objects less difficult
to manage, and by using the most delicate instruments.</p>

<p>We have now considered most of those objects which
require any <em>peculiar</em> treatment in section-cutting, &amp;c.; but
in no branch of microscopic manipulation is experience
more necessary than in this.</p>

<span class="subhead">INJECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">1.</span> Injection is the filling of the arteries, veins, or other
vessels of animals with some coloured substance, in order
that their natural arrangement may be made visible.
This is, of course, a delicate operation, and needs special
apparatus, which I will now attempt to describe.</p>

<p>2. <em>Syringe.</em>—This is usually made to contain about
two ounces. On each side of the part next to the
handle is a ring, so that the finger may be thrust through
it, and the thumb may work the piston as in an ordinary
syringe. The plug of the piston must be “packed” with
wash-leather, and fit so closely as to be perfectly air-tight;
and if, when it has been used awhile, it is found that
some of the liquid escapes past the plug into the back part
of the body, it must be <em>repacked</em>, which operation will be
best understood by examining the part. These syringes
are made of various sizes, but in ordinary operations the above
will be all that is needed. The <em>nozzle</em> is about an inch long,
and polished so accurately that there is no escape when
the <em>pipes</em> are tightly placed upon it <em>dry</em>.</p>

<p>3. The <em>pipes</em> are usually about an inch long, to the end
of which are affixed thicker tubes so as to fit the nozzle, as
before mentioned, whilst a short arm projects from each
side of these, so that the silk or thread which is used to tie
this artery, &amp;c., upon the thin pipe may be carried round
these arms, and all danger of slipping off prevented. The
<em>pipes</em> are made of different sizes, from that which will
admit only a very fine needle (and this will need now and
then to be cleaned, or to be freed from any chance obstruction),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
to that which will take a large pin. These sizes must
always be at hand, as the vessels of some subjects are
exceedingly minute.</p>

<p>4. <em>Stopcock.</em>—This is a short pipe like a small <em>straight</em>
tap, which fits accurately upon the end of the syringe like
the pipes, and also takes the pipes in the same manner.
The use of this is absolutely necessary when the object is
so large that one syringe full of liquid will not fill it. If
no preventive were used, some part of the liquid would return
whilst the syringe was being replenished, but the stopcock
is then turned as in an ordinary tap, and all danger of this
effectually removed.</p>

<p>5. <em>Curved needles.</em>—These are easily made by heating
common needles at the end where the eye is situated, and
bending them with a small pair of “pliers” into a segment
of a circle half an inch in diameter. They are, perhaps, more
convenient when the bent part is thrown slightly back
where it commences. The pointed end is then thrust into
a common penholder, and the needle needs no re-tempering,
as the work for which it is wanted is simply to convey the
thread or silk <em>under</em> any artery or vessel where it would be
impossible to reach with the unassisted fingers.</p>

<p>6. A kind of <em>forceps</em>, commonly know by the name of
“bullnose forceps,” will be constantly required during the
process of injecting. These are short, usually very strong,
but not heavy, and close very tightly by their own spring,
which may be easily overcome and so released by the
pressure of the fingers. When any vessel has not been
tied by the operator, and he finds the injected fluid
escaping, one of these “bulldogs” may be taken up and
closed upon the opening. This will cause very little interruption,
and the stoppage will be almost as effectual as
if it were tied.</p>

<p>7. When the ordinary mode of injection is employed, it
is necessary that the preparations be kept warm during
the time they are used, otherwise the gelatine or size which
they contain becomes stiff, and will not allow of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
worked by the syringe. For this purpose we must procure
small earthenware or tin pots of the size required, which
will differ according to the kind of work to be done; and to
each of these a loose lid should be adapted to protect it
from dust, &amp;c. These pots must be allowed to stand in
a tin bath of water, under which a lamp or gas flame
may be placed to keep the temperature sufficiently high
to insure the perfect fluidity of the mixture. The tin
bath is, perhaps, most convenient when made like a small
shallow cistern; but some close it on the top to place
the pots upon it, and alter the shape to their own convenience.</p>

<p>8. We will now inquire into some of the materials which
are needed in this operation; the first of which is <em>size</em>.
This substance is often used in the form of <em>glue</em>, but it
must be of the very best and most transparent kind. To
make the liquid which is to receive the colours for the
usual mode of injecting, take of this glue seven ounces, and
pour upon it one quart of clean water; allow this to stand
a few hours, and then boil gently until it is thoroughly
dissolved, stirring with a wooden or glass rod during the
process. Take all impurities from the surface, and strain
through flannel or other fine medium. The weather affects
this a little as to its stiffness when cold, but this must be
counteracted by adding a little more glue if found too
liquid.</p>

<p>9. Instead of glue, gelatine is generally used, especially
when the work to be accomplished is of the finer
kind. The proportions are very different in this case,
one ounce of gelatine to about fourteen ounces of water
being sufficient. This, like glue, must be soaked a few
hours in a small part of the cold water, the remainder
being boiled and added, when it must be stirred until
dissolved. A good size may be made by boiling clean
strips of parchment for awhile, and then straining the
liquid whilst hot through flannel; but when the injections
are to be <em>transparent</em>, it is of the greatest importance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the size be as colourless as possible. For this purpose
good gelatine must be employed, as Nelson’s or Cox’s: some
persons of experience prefer the latter.</p>

<p>10. <em>Colours.</em>—The size-solution above mentioned will
need some colouring matter to render it visible when
injected into the vessels of any animal, and different colours
are used when two or more kinds of vessels are so treated,
in order that each “set” may be easily distinguished by
sight. The proportion in which these colours are added to
the size-solution may be given as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="in0">Whichever of these colours is made use of must be levigated
in a mortar with the addition of a very small quantity of
water until every lump of colour or foreign matter is reduced
to the finest state possible, otherwise in the process of injecting
it will most likely be found that some of the small channels
have been closed and the progress of the liquid stopped.
When this fineness of particles is attained, warmth sufficient
to render the size quite fluid must be used, and the colour
added gradually, stirring all the time with a rod. It may
be here mentioned that where one colour only is required,
vermilion is, perhaps, the best; and blue is seldom used
for opaque objects, as it reflects very little more light than
black.</p>

<p>12. When it is wished to fill the capillaries (the minute
vessels connecting the arteries with the veins), the “Micrographic
Dictionary” recommends the colouring matter to be
made by double decomposition. As a professed handbook
would be, perhaps, deemed incomplete without some directions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
as to the mode of getting these colours, I will here
make use of those given in that work. For red, however,
vermilion, as above stated, may be used; but it must be
carefully examined by reflected light to see whether it be free
from all colourless crystals or not. It must first be worked in
a mortar, and then the whole thrown into a quantity of
water and stirred about; after leaving it not longer than
a quarter of a minute, the larger portions will settle to
the bottom, and the liquid being poured off will contain the
finer powder. This may then be dried slowly, or added to
the size whilst wet in the manner before advised.</p>

<p>16. It may here be repeated, that it is only when the capillaries
are to be filled that there is any need to be at the trouble
to prepare the colours by this double decomposition; and,
indeed, colours ground so finely may be procured that the
above instructions would have been omitted, had it not been
supposed that some students might find a double pleasure
in performing as much of the work as possible by their own
unaided labours.</p>

<p>17. The process of injection may now be considered; but
it is impossible for written instructions to supply the place of
experience. I will do my best, however, to set the novice at
least in the right way. There are two kinds of injection—one
where the object and colours are opaque, and consequently
fit for examination by <em>reflected</em> light only; the
other, where the vessels are filled with transparent colours,
and must be viewed by <em>transmitted</em> light. The first of these
is most frequently employed, so we will begin with it. In
the object which is to be injected a vessel of the kind which
we wish to be filled must be found; an opening must then
be made in it to allow one of the small pipes before mentioned
to be thrust some distance within it. When this is
accomplished, thread the curved needle with a piece of silk
thread, or very fine string, which some operators rub well
with beeswax. This thread must not be too thin, else there
is danger of cutting the vessel. The cord is then carried
under the inserted pipe, and the vessel bound tightly upon
it, the ends being brought up round the transverse arms,
and there tied; so that all danger of accidentally withdrawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the pipe is obviated. Care must now be used in
closing all the vessels which communicate with that where
the pipe is placed lest the injecting fluid escape; and this
must be done by tieing them with silk. Should, however,
any of these be left open by accident, the bullnose forceps
must be made use of, as before recommended.</p>

<p>18. The part to be injected must now be immersed in
warm water, not, however, above 100° Fahrenheit, and be
left until the whole is thoroughly warmed. Whilst this is
being done, the coloured size must be made ready by the pot
being placed in the tin bath of warm water, which must be
of sufficient temperature (about 110° Fahrenheit) to keep it
perfectly liquid. For the same purpose, the syringe is often
tightly covered with two or three folds of flannel; and,
indeed, there is no part of the process which requires more
attention. If the substance to be injected is too hot, it is
injured; whilst, if any of the articles are too cold, the gelatine,
or size, loses a part of its fluidity, and consequently
cannot enter the minute parts. When all is prepared, the
syringe, with the stopcock attached, should be warmed, and
then filled and emptied with the injecting fluid two or three
times, care being taken that the end of the syringe be kept
beneath any bubbles which form upon the surface. The
syringe may then be filled, and closely attached to the pipe
which is tied in the vessel. With a firm and steady pressure
the piston must be forced downwards, when the substance
will be perceived to swell, and the colour show itself in places
where the covering is thin. When the syringe is <em>almost</em>
emptied of its contents, the stopcock must be turned to prevent
any escape of the injection from the subject. It must then be
refilled, as in the first instance, and the process repeated. I
say <em>almost emptied</em>, because it is well not to force the piston
of the syringe quite to the bottom, lest the small quantity
of air which frequently remains be driven into some of the
vessels, and the object be injured or quite ruined. As the
injection is proceeded with, it will be found that the force
required grows greater, yet care must be taken not to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
too much, or the vessels will burst, and render all the labour
fruitless. The movement of the piston must be occasionally
so slow as to be almost imperceptible, and for this reason it is
sometimes marked with lines about one-eighth of an inch
apart.</p>

<p>19. Of course, during the whole process the injecting
fluid and subject must be kept at a temperature high enough
to allow the liquid to flow freely; and the escape of a little
of it need cause no fears to the student, as it is almost impossible
to fill any subject without some loss. When the
injected object has received sufficient fluid, it should have a
plump appearance, owing to all the vessels being well filled.
The vessel must then be tied up where the pipe was inserted,
and the whole left in cold water two or three hours, after
which time it may be mounted; but it may be well to notice
a few things which the beginner ought to know before entering
into that part of the process; and he may be here informed
that it is not necessary to mount the objects immediately,
otherwise it would be impossible for one person to make
use of half of any large subject, as it would be in a state
of decay long before each part could have been examined
and separated. Large pieces should be therefore immersed
in equal parts of spirits of wine and water, or
glycerine, which some think better still, and thus preserved
in bottles until time can be given to a closer examination.</p>

<p>20. In operating upon large subjects, entire animals,
&amp;c., the constant pressure required by the piston of the
syringe grows wearisome, besides occupying both hands,
which is sometimes inconvenient when working without
assistance. To obviate this, another way of driving the
syringe was published in the “Micrographic Dictionary”
which I will quote here:—“We have therefore contrived a
very simple piece of apparatus, which any one can prepare
for himself, and which effects the object by mechanical
means. It consists of a rectangular piece of board, two feet
long and ten inches wide, to one end of which is fastened an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
inclined piece of wood (equal in width to the long board,
and one foot high). The inclined portion is pierced with
three holes, one above the other, into either of which the
syringe may be placed—the uppermost being used for the
larger, the lowermost for the smaller syringe; and these
holes are of such size as freely to admit the syringe covered
with flannel, but not to allow the rings to pass through
them. The lower part of the syringe is supported upon a
semiannular piece of wood, fastened to the upper end of an
upright rod, which slides in a hollow cylinder fixed at its
base to a small rectangular piece of wood; and by means of
a horizontal wooden screw, the rod may be made to support
the syringe at any height required. The handle of the
syringe is let into a groove in a stout wooden rod connected
by means of two catgut strings with a smaller rod, to the
middle of which is fastened a string playing over a pulley,
and at the end of which is a hook for supporting weights,
the catgut strings passing through a longitudinal slit in the
inclined piece of wood.” When in use the syringe is filled
with injecting fluid, and passed through one of the three
holes which is most suitable. The object being placed so
that the pipe and syringe can be best joined, the rod
and strings are set in order, and a weight placed on
the hook. The stopcock must then be opened gradually,
when the operator will be able to judge whether the weight
is a proper one or not: if the piston is driven with any
speed, there is danger of injuring the subject, and less
weight may be used; if, however, the piston does not move,
more must be added.</p>

<p>21. Such is the method recommended by the “Micrographic
Dictionary,” and perhaps it is as good as any
mechanical plan could be; but where the operator is willing
to undergo the labour of performing all this with the hand,
he has a much better chance of succeeding, because the
pressure can be regulated so accurately, and changed so
quickly when requisite, that no mere machine can compete
with it, however well contrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
22. When the beginner attempts to inject a subject, one
of his difficulties is finding the vessel from which to commence.
Another consists in distinguishing the arteries
from the veins; but this is partly removed by making a
longitudinal incision in the vessel, and with a blunt thick
needle probing a little distance into the tube. The artery
will be found thicker in the coating than the vein, and the
difference is easily perceived by this mode of testing: the
vein is also of a bluer colour than the artery. I say above,
a “longitudinal incision” must be made: the reason for
this is, the artery when cut across contracts considerably,
and is lost in the adjoining substance; but where the
opening is made <em>longitudinally</em> all danger of this contraction
is obviated.</p>

<p>23. The different systems of vessels are often injected
with various colours, so that their relative positions, &amp;c.,
may be shown most clearly. In some specimens, the veins
are injected with white, and the arteries with red; in the
kidney, the urinary tubes are often filled with white, and
the arteries with red. Then, again, the liver affords tubes
for three or four colours. But no written instructions on
this point can benefit the young student, and he must be
content for a while to employ himself with single colours
until he has gained the mechanical skill and the primary
knowledge which are necessary before he can make any
advance.</p>

<p>24. We will now consider the best methods of <em>mounting</em>
injected objects. They must always be well washed
in water after they have been kept in any preservative
liquid, using a camel-hair pencil to clean the surface if
necessary. Many parts when injected are in masses, such
as the lungs, liver, &amp;c., of animals, and consequently sections
of these must be cut. For this purpose Valentine’s knife
is very convenient, as the thickness can be regulated so
easily; but where the injections are opaque, there is no
need to have the sections very thin. Some few of this
kind undergo comparatively little change in drying, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the section may be well washed and floated upon the glass
slide in the place desired, where it will dry perfectly and
adhere to it. It must be then moistened with turpentine
and mounted in Canada balsam like other objects. No great
heat should be used with these preparations, as it is very
liable to injure them; and some of the colours seem to
suffer a slight contraction when any great degree of warmth
is applied. There are many objects, however, which
must be seen in the mass to be understood, and, indeed,
lose all their form and beauty in drying, such as certain
parts of the intestines, &amp;c. These must be mounted in
fluid, with the precautions noticed at length in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV.</a>,
and for this purpose either Goadby’s fluid, the chloride of
zinc solution, or spirit diluted with ten parts of distilled
water, may be employed. It is a good thing, when practicable,
to mount similar objects on two separate slides,
using different preservative liquids, and taking the precaution
of marking each with the kind of liquid employed.
This not only serves as a guide to what is best for certain
subjects, but if one is injured, there will probably be a
good specimen in the other.</p>

<p>25. It may be here mentioned that many are now mounting
sections of injected substances with the balsam and
chloroform before mentioned, instead of using balsam alone,
and consider that the labour is much lessened thereby.</p>

<p>26. A description of that mode of injection which is most
generally employed has now been given, but this is not
the only method of effecting our object. A most ingenious
process was invented by M. Doyers, requiring no artificial
warmth, by which many beautiful objects have been prepared.
Make a solution of bichromate of potash, 524 grains
to a pint of water, and throw this into the vessels to be
injected; then take 1,000 grains of acetate of lead dissolved
in half a pint of water, and force this into the same vessels.
A decomposition now takes place in the vessels, and the
yellow chromate of lead is formed. In this decomposition,
however, the acetate of potash also is formed and as this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
salt has an injurious action upon the cells, Dr. Goadby
recommends nitrate of lead to be used, which preserves
rather than destroys them. He also advises the addition
of two ounces of gelatine dissolved in eight ounces of water,
to eight ounces of the saturated solution of each salt; but
with this addition the hot-water bath would be required to
keep the injecting fluid liquid.</p>

<p>27. Many of these are best mounted in balsam, in the
same manner as those made in the ordinary way; whilst
others are best shown when preserved in liquids, for which
purpose Goadby’s fluid may be employed.</p>

<p>28. This mode of making injections with chromate of
lead is deemed by many the best, especially where one
colour only is employed. But it must be allowed that
there is a little more danger of failure where two separate
fluids are used for the same vessels.</p>

<p>29. We will now consider the best manner of making
<em>transparent</em> injections, which, for many purposes, possess an
undoubted advantage over the opaque ones. But it must
be remembered that there are certain subjects to which no
transparent injection could be applied, as they are too thick
when in their natural state, and cutting would destroy all
that beauty which is shown by the different parts in their
relative adaptation. For those objects, however, which
must be cut into sections to display their wonders, or are
naturally thin—such as some of the finer tissues, livers,
kidneys, &amp;c.—transparency is a great acquisition, and
enables us to understand the arrangement of the vessels
more perfectly. Again, another advantage is the simplicity
of the process; no hot water is needed with some preparations,
either for the subject or the injecting fluid, which
runs into the minute vessels thoroughly and easily, whilst
the cost is small.</p>

<p>30. For this kind of injection no colour is so commonly
made use of as Prussian blue. It is not a good one, as
was before stated, for any opaque object, as the light
reflected from it appears almost black; yet by transmitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
light no colour is more useful, because its distinctness
is equally great by artificial light and ordinary daylight.
The method of preparing this, as given by Dr. Beale, is as
<span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<table class="narrow25" summary="prussian blue">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Glycerine</td>
    <td class="tdl">  1 ounce.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Wood naphtha, or pyroacetic acid</td>
    <td class="tdl">  1½ drachm.</td></tr>

    <td class="tdl">  1 drachm.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Water</td>
    <td class="tdl">  4 ounces.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">Dissolve the ferrocyanide of potash in one ounce of the
water; add the tincture of sesquichloride of iron to another
ounce. Mix these solutions gradually together, shaking the
bottle well which contains them—it is best to add the iron
to the potash solution. When thoroughly mixed, these
solutions should produce a dark-blue mixture, perfectly
free from any perceptible masses or flocculi. Next mix the
naphtha and spirits of wine, and add the glycerine and the
remaining two ounces of water. This must now be slowly
mixed with the blue liquid, shaking the whole well in a
large bottle whilst the two come together. The tincture of
sesquichloride of iron is recommended, because it can always
be obtained of a uniform strength.</p>

<p>31. Dr. Turnbull used a mixture slightly different from the
above, which is made with the sulphate of <span class="locked">iron:—</span></p>

<table class="narrow25" summary="Dr Turnbull's prussian blue">

<p class="in0">Dissolve the sulphate of iron in one ounce of the water,
gradually add the ferrocyanide of potassium dissolved in
another ounce, and proceed as above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
32. Dr. Beale also gives us the following carmine injection
to be employed in the same way as the blue.<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> <span class="locked">Take—</span></p>

<table class="narrow25" summary="carmine">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Carmine</td>
    <td class="tdl"> 5 grains.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Glycerine, with 8 or 10 drops of hydrochloric acid</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Water</td>
    <td class="tdl"> 6 drachms.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">Mix the carmine with a few drops of water, and when well
incorporated add about five drops of liquor ammoniæ. To
this dark-red solution about half an ounce of the glycerine is
to be added, and the whole well shaken in a bottle. Next,
very gradually pour in the acid glycerine, frequently shaking
the bottle during admixture. Test the mixture with blue
litmus-paper, and if not of a very decidedly acid reaction, a
few more drops of acid may be added to the remainder of
the glycerine and mixed as before. Lastly, mix the alcohol
and water very gradually, shaking the bottle thoroughly
after adding each successive portion till the whole is mixed.
This fluid may be kept ready prepared, and injections made
very rapidly with it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_G" href="#FNanchor_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> When, however, it is desirable to cut very thin sections of the
injected subject, the carmine is sometimes added to a solution of fine
gelatine—gelatine one part to water eight parts. But the warm water
and mode of proceeding which are used with the size solutions before
described will be necessary in this case also.</p></div>

<p>33. The method of making injections with these colours
is the same as with the gelatine mixtures before described,
except that no heat is required, and consequently most of
the trouble removed. The bottle of the fluid must be well
shaken immediately before use; and when the object is
injected, we must allow it to remain in a cool place for a
few hours before cutting it. Thin sections of the subject
may be cut with Valentine’s knife, as before described, and
are very beautiful transparent objects. Some of the finer
tissues, also, are shown much better by this mode of injection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
than by the opaque, and are easily mounted by
washing in clean water when first separated, and floating
upon a slide, where they must be allowed to dry
thoroughly. They may then be immediately mounted in
balsam, or kept in the dry state until it is convenient to
finish them; but in many cases this keeping, if too much
prolonged, will injure the object. If it is desired to
transfer the section to another slide, it will be necessary to
wet it thoroughly with water by the aid of a camel-hair
pencil, and then gently strip it off with the forceps.
When it is wished to preserve injected subjects in
“masses,” it must be done by immersion in spirit, and
the sections may be cut at leisure. Most of these transparent
objects may be mounted in Canada balsam; but
some recommend glycerine or glycerine jelly, as allowing
the use of a higher power in their examination, and preserving
them in a more natural form.</p>

<p>34. A few subjects may be noticed which are very
beautiful when injected, and amongst these are the
eyes of many animals. They must be injected by
the artery in the back part, and when the blue transparent
liquid is employed, nothing can exceed the delicate
beauty which some of the membrane bears. It must, however,
be dissected with care, but well repays us for the
trouble. Water-newts and frogs are not difficult subjects,
and in their skin and other parts are many interesting
objects. Amongst the commoner animals—rats, rabbits, cats,
&amp;c. &amp;c.—almost endless employment may be found, making
use either of portions or the whole animal at once. The
intestines of many of these are very beautiful. We must
divide them with a pair of scissors along the tube, and
cleanse them from all the matter; the coating may then be
laid upon a slide, and any remaining impurity removed
with a camel-hair pencil and water. When dried it may
be mounted in balsam, and having been injected with
the transparent blue, its minute beauty is shown most
perfectly. In injecting a sheep’s foot, which is a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
object, the liquid should be forced into it until a slight
paring of the hoof shows the colour in the fine channels
there.</p>

<p>35. When the lungs of small animals are injected, the
finest fluid must be used, as some of the capillaries are so
small that it is not an easy matter to fill them properly.
And before entering upon these subjects, a certain proficiency
in the mode of using the syringe, &amp;c., should be
obtained by practising upon simpler parts.</p>

<p>36. No subjects are more difficult to inject than fish,
owing to the extreme softness of their tissues. Dr. Hogg
recommends the tail of the fish to be cut off, and the pipe
to be put into the divided vessel which lies just beneath the
spinal column; by which method beautiful injections may
be made. The gills, however, are the most interesting part
as microscopic objects.</p>

<p>37. These instructions may seem very imperfect to those
who have had much experience in this branch; but they
will remember that their own knowledge was not gained
from any written descriptions, but was forced upon them
by frequent failures, some of which probably were very disheartening.
As I before stated, it is very difficult (if not
impossible) to accomplish much without some knowledge of
anatomy.</p>

<p>38. I may here mention that the transparent injections
sent over from the Continent are beautifully executed by
Hyrtl of Vienna (who states that the injected fluid is composed
of gelatine and carmine), Dr. Oschatz of Berlin,
the Microscopic Institute of Wabern, Schaffer and Co. of
Magdeburg, and others. Some of these will bear examining
with a high power. A friend informs me that he measured
a vessel in a rat’s tongue by Hyrtl, which was 1-7200th
of an inch in diameter, and had a clear outline with quarter-inch
objective. He has also made many experiments with
the same materials, but has as yet failed in producing
perfectly distinct outlines, there being a tendency of the
colouring matter (magenta, carmine. &amp;c.) to diffuse itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
through the coats of the vessels into the surrounding tissues,
although he has varied the pressure from one half a pound
to sixty pounds. He believes the vessels are first washed
out (injected with warm water and pressure applied), then
some fluid introduced which renders the arteries impervious
to the coloured fluid afterwards injected.</p>

<p>39. He finds that after washing out the vessels as above,
the injecting fluid is much more easily introduced. He
has used a strong solution of gallic acid previously to injecting
with the colouring matter (in one experiment only), and
the result was satisfactory. He puts the query,—Might not
carbolic acid have a similar effect? He has often used it
with injections to preserve the specimens, but not in sufficient
quantity to act in the way indicated above.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, Mr. J. G. Dale, F.C.S., and I
have made numerous experiments with carmine injection,
and have at length been favoured with what we deem
success. Some of the vessels in a kitten lately injected do
not exceed 1-2000th of an inch in diameter, and present a
clear outline with one-fifth objective. There is no extra-vasation,
neither does the colouring matter show any grain
except when a very high power is employed. The following
is our <span class="locked">process:—</span></p>

<table summary="carmine variation">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl w3">Take</td>
    <td class="tdl">180 grains best carmine.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td class="tdl hang3">   ½ fluid ounce of ammonia, commercial strength, viz., 0·92, or 15° ammonia meter.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td> </td>
    <td class="tdl hang3">    3 or 4 ounces distilled water.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">Put these into a small flask, and allow them to digest without
heat from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, or until the
carmine is dissolved. Then take a Winchester quart bottle,
and with a diamond mark the spot to which sixteen ounces
of water extend. The coloured solution must be filtered
into the bottle, and to this pure water should be added
until the whole is equal to sixteen ounces.</p>

<p>Dissolve 600 grains potash alum in ten fluid ounces of
water, and add to this, under constant boiling, a solution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
of carbonate of soda until a slight permanent precipitate is
produced. Filter and add water up to sixteen ounces.
Boil and add the solution to the cold ammoniacal solution
of carmine in the Winchester quart, and shake vigorously
for a few minutes. A drop of this placed upon white
filtering-paper should show no coloured ring. If much
colour is in solution the whole must be rejected, because,
although it is possible to precipitate all the colouring
matter by the addition of ammonia or alum, it is not well
to do so, as the physical condition of the precipitate is
thereby altered.</p>

<p>Supposing the precipitation to be complete, or very
nearly so, shake vigorously for at least half an hour, and
allow it to stand until quite cold. The shaking must then
be renewed for some time, and the bottle filled up with pure
water.</p>

<p>After allowing the precipitate to settle a day, draw off
the clear supernatant fluid with a syphon. Repeat the
washing until the clear liquid gives little or no precipitate
with chloride of barium. So much water must be left
with the colour at last that it shall measure forty fluid
ounces.</p>

<p>For the injecting fluid take twenty-four ounces of the
above coloured liquid, and three ounces of good gelatine.
Allow these to remain together twelve hours, and then
dissolve by the heat of a water bath; after which it should
be strained through fine muslin.</p>

<p>As this injecting fluid contains gelatine, the hot water,
and other contrivances mentioned in a former part of the
chapter, will be necessary here also, but no peculiar treatment
will be required.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII" class="vspace"><span class="gesperrt">CHAPTER VII</span>.<br />

<span class="subhead">MISCELLANEOUS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> must be evident to all readers that there are various
objects of interest to the microscopist which cannot be
properly placed amongst any of the forementioned classes,
but must not be omitted in such a guide as this professes
to be. Of these may be mentioned the circulation of the
blood in various animals, the rotary motion of the fluid
in many plants, the best means of taking minute photographs,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of these objects is the circulation
of the blood through the finer vessels of various parts of
the animals made use of for these purposes, which parts, it
is evident, must be very transparent to afford a perfect view
of this phenomenon. The web of the frog’s foot is very
frequently made use of, but requires a certain arrangement,
which we will now describe. A piece of thin wood (Dr.
Carpenter recommends <em>cork</em>) is taken, about eight inches
long and three wide; about an inch from one end is cut
a hole, half or three-quarters of an inch in diameter. The
body of the frog is then placed in a wet bag, or wrapped in
wet calico, whilst the hind-foot projects; the whole is then
laid upon the piece of wood so that the foot, which is left
free, may be extended over the hole. The web must then
be spread out, and secured either by threads to small pins
on the wood, or the pins must be driven through the web
into the wood, and so kept in position. A few bands of
tape must be passed round the body, the leg, and the wood,
to prevent any disarrangement arising from the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
starting, &amp;c. Care must be taken that the tape is not too
tight, else the circulation will be very slow or altogether
stopped. The wood must now be fixed upon the stage,
with the aperture under the object-glass: this is sometimes
done by simply binding it, or a spring is fixed so as to
accomplish the same object without so much trouble. With
a half-inch power the blood may now be seen to flow very
distinctly. The frog may be used for hours if care is taken
to prevent the web from becoming dry, by wetting it with a
little water from time to time. The piece of wood or cork
upon which the frog is laid is often made to give place
to the “frog-plates,” supplied by opticians. These are
made of brass, somewhat resembling the piece of wood
above recommended, but each maker’s pattern differs according
to his own taste.</p>

<p>The tongue of the frog is also sometimes used for the
purpose of showing the circulation of the blood, which is
done in the following manner:—The body is wrapped
with the calico, and made fast to the plate as before, only
the <em>mouth</em> of the frog is brought to the opening. The
tongue is then gently drawn out of the mouth and pinned
down over the aperture, when the circulation will be well
shown. But, as Dr. Carpenter observes, the cruelty of this
mode of treatment is so repulsive that it is unjustifiable.</p>

<p>Tadpoles of the frog (which, of course, are only obtainable
in their season) are good subjects for showing the circulation
of the blood. They are best suited for the microscope
when about one inch long. The tadpoles of the newt and
toad also are equally suitable. They may be placed in a
very shallow glass trough with a little water, and a narrow
band of linen bound lightly round in some part not required
for examination, to keep them from moving; or they may
be laid upon a glass plate with a drop or two of water, and
a thin glass covering lightly bound upon it. Dr. Carpenter,
however, places them first in cold water, gradually adding
warm until the whole becomes about 100°, when the tadpole
becomes rigid, whilst the circulation is still maintained. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
have not, however, found this necessary, the thin glass
accomplishing all that is desired. The tail is generally the
most transparent, and shows the circulation best; but in
some of the newt larvæ the blood may be traced down to
the very extremities if they are not <em>too old</em>. Mr. Whitney
places the tadpole upon its back, by which means the heart
and other internal arrangements may be seen.</p>

<p>Amongst fishes also may be found subjects for the
same purpose, but they seldom furnish as good examples as
those before mentioned, because the blood-vessels are not
nearly so abundant, as in the foot of the frog, &amp;c. The
stickleback is, however, procurable almost in any place
during the summer months, and may be laid in a shallow
trough, loosely bound down as the tadpole. The tail may
be covered with a piece of thin glass to prevent him curling
it to the object-glass. The power needed with this will be
about the same as with the other subjects—viz., half to
quarter inch object-glass.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely necessary to go to reptiles or fishes
for this curious sight, as some other animals serve very
well. In the wings of the common bat may be found a
good subject. These must be stretched out on something
resembling the frog-plate before described, when those parts
near to the bones will show the <em>largest</em> vessels very clearly.
The ear of a young mouse is an illustration of the same
phenomenon, but it is very difficult to fix it in a good
position, as these animals are so very timid and restless.</p>

<p>Amongst insects also the same law may be observed,
by placing them in the “cage,” or “live-box,” so as to keep
them still, but not to injure them by too much pressure. In
certain larvæ this is particularly well shown, as that of the
day-fly and plumed gnat; but in some of these the blood is
almost colourless. In the wings also of many insects this
circulation is well seen, as in those of the common housefly;
but as these parts become dry in a few days, the
subject should not be more than twenty-four hours old.</p>

<p>Somewhat approximating to the forementioned phenomenon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
is the “rotation” of fluid in the cells, or, as it is
usually termed, the <em>circulation of the sap</em>, of plants. This
is shown in certain vegetable growths as a constant stream
of thick fluid, wherein small globules are seen; which
stream flows round the individual cells, or up the leaf, turning
at the extremity, and down again by a different but
parallel channel. There is little or no difficulty in showing
this in many plants; but some are, of course, better than
others, and require a different treatment; we will, therefore,
notice a few of these. Perhaps the best of all is the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vallisneria spiralis</i>, which is an aquatic plant, frequently
grown in, but not really belonging to, this country. As it
somewhat resembles grass, the leaf is not used in its natural
state, but a thin section cut lengthwise with a razor or
other sharp instrument—this section, however, is much
better when the outer surface has been first removed. It
should then be laid upon a slide with a drop or two of
water, and covered with a piece of thin glass. Often the
cutting of the section seems to be such a shock to the leaf
that no motion is visible for awhile, but in a short time the
warmth of an ordinary sitting-room will revive it, and with
a quarter-inch object-glass the currents will be rendered
beautifully distinct. Where the “stream” is unusually
obstinate the warmth may be slightly increased, but too
great heat destroys the movement altogether. In the
summer, any of the leaves show this “circulation” very well;
but in the winter, the slightly yellow ones are said to be
the best.</p>

<p>The Vallisneria requires to be cut in sections to show
this “circulation;” but there are many plants of which it
is but necessary to take a fragment and lay it upon a
slide. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anacharis alsinastrum</i> is one of these: it grows
in water, having three leaves round the stem, then a bare
portion, again another three leaves, and so on. One of
these leaves must be plucked close to the stem, and laid
upon a slide with a drop of water. Thin glass should be
placed upon it, and along the mid-rib of the leaves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“circulation” may be seen most beautifully when a good
specimen has been chosen; but it requires rather more
power than the Vallisneria. This plant is very common
in many parts of the country, a great number of our
ponds and streams being literally choked up by it. In
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chara vulgaris</i> and two or three of the Nitellæ, &amp;c.,
this phenomenon may also be seen with no preparation
except plucking a part from the stem and laying it upon
a slide as with the Anacharis. In using the Frog-bit, the
outer part of the young leaf-buds must be taken to obtain
the best specimens for this purpose; but a section of the
stem will also show the “circulation,” though not so well.
The plants before mentioned are all aquatic, but the same
movement of the globules has been observed in several kinds
of land plants, as in the hairs upon the leaf-stalks of the
common groundsel; but these do not show it so well, nor
are they so easily managed as the above.</p>

<p>Many microscopists who are not fortunate enough to be
in the neighbourhood of these plants (indeed the Vallisneria
is a foreign one) grow them in jars, so a few remarks as to
the treatment they require will not be out of place. The
Vallisneria requires a temperature not lower than 55° or
60°, and even a higher degree than this renders its growth
quicker; and no great change must take place: the more
equable the temperature the more healthy will the plant be.
A glass jar should be taken, having an inch or two of mould
at the bottom, which must be pressed down closely, and the
plant must be set in this. Water must then be gently
poured in, so as not to disturb the mould. As this plant
flourishes best when the water is frequently changed,
Mr. Quekett recommends that the jar should be occasionally
placed under a tap of water, and a very gentle stream
allowed to fall into it for several hours, by which means
much of the confervoid growth will be got rid of and the
plant invigorated. The Anacharis may be rooted in the
earth like the Vallisneria, but a small detached piece may
be thrown into the jar of water and there left until wanted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
For months the “circulation” will be well shown by
it, and it will probably grow and increase. It is also very
healthy in an in-door aquarium. It is recommended that
the jars in which any of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chara</i> are grown should be
moved about as little as possible, as the long roots are very
tender, and will not bear agitation.</p>

<p>An object which is interesting to the microscopist, as
well as the unscientific observer, is the <em>growth</em> of seeds, as
it is often erroneously termed. A shaving of the outside
of the seed is taken and laid upon the glass slide; a thin
glass cover is then placed upon it, and a drop of water
applied to the edge of this. The water will then gradually
flow under the glass and reach the section of the seed, when
the transparent fibres will appear to spring out and “grow”
for some minutes. This, however, is produced by the unfolding
of a spiral formation in the cells, and, therefore, has
really no similarity to the true growth. The seeds of the
Salvias, Collomias, Senecio, Ruellia, &amp;c., are well suited for
the display of this curious sight.</p>

<p>To watch the development of the spores of ferns, and the
fertilization and products, Dr. Carpenter recommends the
following mode of proceeding:—“Let a frond of a fern,
whose fructification is mature, be laid upon a piece of fine
paper, with its spore-bearing surface downwards; in the
course of a day or two this paper will be found to be covered
with a very fine brownish dust, which consists of the discharged
spores. This must be carefully collected, and should
be spread upon the surface of a smoothed fragment of porous
sandstone; the stone being placed in a saucer, the bottom
of which is covered with water, and a glass ‘tumbler’
being inverted over it, the requisite supply of moisture is
insured, and the spores will germinate luxuriantly. Some
of the prothallia soon advance beyond the rest; and at the
time when the advanced ones have long ceased to produce
antheridia, and bear abundance of archegonia, those which
have remained behind in their growth are beginning to be
covered with antheridia. If the crop be now kept with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
little moisture for several weeks and then suddenly watered,
a large number of antheridia and archegonia simultaneously
open, and in a few hours afterwards the surface of the
larger prothallia will be found almost covered with moving
antherozoids. Such prothallia as exhibit freshly opened
archegonia are now to be held by one lobe between the
forefinger and thumb of the left hand, so that the upper
surface of the prothallium lies upon the thumb; and the
thinnest possible sections are then to be made with a
narrow-bladed knife perpendicularly to the surface of the
prothallium. Of these sections, which after much practice
may be made no more than 1-15th of a line of thickness,
some will probably lay open the canals of the archegonia,
and within these, when examined with a power of 200 or
300 diameters, antherozoids may be occasionally distinguished.”</p>

<p>Another interesting object to the young microscopist is
afforded by the spores of the equiseta (or horsetails, as
they are often called). These may be obtained by shaking
the higher portion of the stems when the spores are ripe.
They will then fall like small dust, and may be placed
under the microscope. The spores are then seen to consist
of a somewhat heart-shaped mass with bands rather
intricately curled around it. As they dry these bands
expand, and are seen to be four lines at right angles, with
the ends clubbed, as it may be called. If, whilst watching
them, the spores are breathed upon, these bands immediately
return to their former state, and are closely curled around
the spore; but as they gradually dry again expand. This
experiment may be repeated many times, and is a very
interesting one.</p>

<p>The above are the principal objects which could not possibly
be included in any of the former chapters, but would
have left a most interesting branch untouched had it
been neglected. There is another subject also which
should not be passed by—viz., the production of minute
pictures which serve as objects for microscopic examination.</p>

<p>I may here mention that as this manual is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
simply to enable the young student to prepare and mount
his objects, the photography of <em>magnified</em> objects has
evidently no place here.</p>

<p>Few slides caused so much astonishment as these minute
photographs when first exhibited; small spots were seen to
contain large pictures, and a page of printed matter was
compressed into the one-hundredth part of a square inch.
It would be impossible in this place to give the inquirer
any instruction in the manipulation of photography, so it
must be assumed that he already knows this.</p>

<p>We will first consider the process performed by artificial
light. The collodion employed in photographing generally
shows as much structure when magnified as is found in
linen of moderate texture; but this is not always the case,
as some samples bear much enlargement without any of
this appearance. It is evident that a structure so coarse
would make it entirely unfit for these minute pictures, as
all the small markings would be destroyed, or so interfered
with that no great enlargement would be practicable.
To obtain almost structureless collodion is not an easy
matter, and a clever practitioner in this branch of photography
states that he knows of no method to accomplish
this with certainty, but he himself tries different samples
until he falls upon a suitable one, which he then lays aside
for this object. A beneficial effect is often derived from
keeping the collodion awhile, but this is not always the
case. The slides should be chosen of an equal thickness, so
that when focussed upon one no re-adjustment may be
necessary for the others. The glass should, of course, be
free from any roughness, scratches, or other imperfections,
and of first-rate quality and colour.</p>

<p>The microscope must then be placed in a horizontal
position, and the eye-piece removed, the stage having a
small clip upon it to keep the prepared plate in position.
The negative must then be supported at a distance from
the end of the microscope tube from which the eye-piece was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
withdrawn. This distance will, of course, vary according to
the relative sizes of the negative and desired picture.
With a one-inch object-glass, which is a very convenient
focus, it will have to be changed usually betwixt one and
four feet. The negative must be lighted by an argand
gas-burner or camphine-lamp, and the rays rendered as
parallel as possible by the use of a large lens placed
betwixt the light and the negative. It is not easy to
arrange the apparatus so as to get the light <em>uniform</em>; but
a little practice will soon do away with this difficulty.
Ordinary ground-glass is too coarsely grained to focus upon,
as the magnifying power used to examine the minute
reflection must be considerable. One of the slides must
therefore be coated with the collodion, submitted to the
silver-bath, and after washing with water be allowed to
dry. Upon this may be focussed the reflected image,
and its minuteness examined with a powerful hand-magnifier,
or another microscope placed behind in a horizontal
position. When the utmost sharpness of definition is
obtained, it is usually required to remove the plate a little
distance from the object-glass, as object-glasses for the
microscope are slightly “over corrected,” and the chemical
rays which accomplish the photography are beyond the
visual ones. The exact distance required to give a picture
to bear the greatest enlargement cannot be given by rule;
but experiments must be made at first, and it will always
be the same with the object-glass which we have tested.</p>

<p>The plate may now be prepared as in ordinary photography,
and placed upon the stage whilst the light is
shaded. When all is ready, the shade is removed and the
process allowed to go on, usually for thirty or forty seconds;
but no certain rule can be given as to the required time, on
account of various collodions, lamps, and powers being used.
It may be here mentioned, that it is well to contrive some
little frame to receive the prepared plate, as the silver bath
solution is liable to get upon the microscope stage and so,
to say the least, disfigure it. When the exposure has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
continued sufficiently long, the picture may be developed by
any of the ordinary methods, but some of the best productions
have been brought out by the aid of pyrogallic and
citric acid solution, with the addition of a little alcohol.
The “fixing” may be effected by a strong solution of hypo-sulphite
of soda, and the picture must then be very well
washed with pure water. When dry, the photograph must
be mounted with Canada balsam, in the same manner as
any ordinary object; but great heat must not be used, or
the picture may be injured.</p>

<p>When ordinary daylight is employed for this purpose,
a dark slide will be required for the prepared plate,
in the same way as for photographing landscape, &amp;c.
These dark slides are generally made by each individual
to suit his particular arrangements of negatives, &amp;c.; but
it may be here recommended that the operator should
always focus in the same slide which he is about to use, as
so small a difference in distance lies betwixt perfection and
failure.</p>

<p>For an ordinary student, perhaps the above method is that
which is the most readily used, and consequently the most
generally available; but almost every one has a different
arrangement of microscope, &amp;c., by which he procures these
minute pictures. Mr. Shadbolt (one of our most successful
photographers) gives the following instructions:—“Having
removed the upper stage plate of a large compound microscope,
I replace it with one of wood, supplied with guide
pins of silver wire, in order to admit of its supporting a slip
of glass coated with collodion, and excited in the nitrate
of silver bath in the usual way. If the ordinary brass
stage plate were left undisturbed, it is obvious that it and
the excited slip of glass would be mutually destructive.</p>

<p>“The microscope is now to be placed in a horizontal
position, the objective, intended to produce the picture,
made to occupy the place usually filled by the achromatic
condenser on the <em>sub-stage</em> of the microscope, while <em>another</em>
objective is screwed into the lower end of the body of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
instrument, which is used not only to focus with, but also
to make the requisite allowance for actinic variation.</p>

<p>“The negative intended to be reduced is then arranged
vertically, with its centre in the axis of the microscopic
body, at a distance of from two to four feet from the lower
object-glass, and with a convenient screen of card, wood, or
thick paper, to cut off any extraneous light that would
otherwise pass beyond the limits of the picture.</p>

<p>“A small camphine-lamp is employed for the purpose of
illuminating the negative, having a good bull’s-eye lens as
a condenser, so arranged with its flat side next the lamp
that the refracted rays shall just fill the whole of a double
convex lens of about six inches in diameter, the latter being
placed in such a position as to refract the rays of light in a
parallel direction upon the negative. By this arrangement
the <em>bull’s-eye lens</em> of about two inches and a half in
diameter <em>appears</em> as the source of the light instead of the
small flame of the lamp.</p>

<p>“By using a bat’s-wing gas-burner of a good size, a <em>single</em>
lens, instead of the two, may be so placed as to give the
necessary uniformity of illumination.”</p>

<p>This arrangement requires the same care in working as
that before mentioned, the pictures being produced, developed,
and fixed by the same treatment.</p>

<p>As before stated, almost every manipulator makes
some small changes in the method of producing these
minute pictures; but the rules given, though far from
new, are sufficient for all purposes; and I may state with
truth, that those which I procured when these wonders
were quite new, are fully equal in every respect to the best
usually met with at the present time.</p>

<p>With these instructions I shall close my Handbook, as I
believe that every branch of Preparation and Mounting
of Microscopic Objects has been treated of. Not that
the beginner can expect that he has nothing to do except
read this to be able to mount everything; but there
are difficulties from which he may be freed by instruction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
when otherwise he would have been compelled to learn by
failure alone. I may, here, however, repeat certain advice
before given,—that, when practicable, it is a good thing
to mount each object by two or more different methods,
as very frequently one feature is best shown dry, another in
liquid, and a third in balsam. Secondly, let the <em>mounting</em>
be studied thoroughly, as no part of the microscopic
science is more worthy of thought than this. And lastly,
let no failures prevent you following up what will assuredly
one day become a source of great pleasure, and render your
daily “constitutional walk,” which is often dull in the
extreme, very delightful, as it will afford you some new
wonder in every hedge-row.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
